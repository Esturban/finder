We specialize in residential asphalt shingle re-roofing and are certified CertainTeed ShingleMasters. Trevor is the son of Brian and Dorothy McDonald, who  successfully owned and operated McDonald’s Flooring in Maple Ridge for over 40 years. After taking several business and marketing classes in college, and then learning the trade over six years, Trevor decided to operate his own roofing company. Beginning as a modest residential re-roofing and repairing business, Ridge Meadows Roofing has grown into a full-fledged team of skilled professionals, who consistently provide great service and demonstrate their workmanship on each and every roof. But even with a talented team of roofing professionals, Trevor carefully oversees all tasks.

Company Founder- Shayne Finskars
Shayne started general construction by taking on residential renovations in his first home and using his lengthy carpentry and construction experience to conduct the renovations. During this time he gained recognition from family, friends and others over social media for the custom look and quality of these renovations. Many neighbours, friends and acquaintances asked him to take on the general contractor role for their renovations, provide advice or take on the project completely. He gained significant experience and furthered his education in the renovation and building science fields. As a result, he has taken on a number of general contractor projects while supplementing his knowledge through general residential construction course work and supply management research. As a result Shayne has gained a great appreciation for the general contracting process, attained significant knowledge on a variety of construction materials, and developed significant relationships with clientele. The progression/development in modern building sciences, and being able to build beautiful projects have motivated him to do outstanding work. Shayne loves seeing the smiles and joy that people get when they see their finished project and continues to be fascinated by new product lines, designs and ingenuity in construction by always seeking to create beautiful, quality, sustainable, cost effective construction solutions while ensuring customers are ecstatic in the reveal of the final product.

Members of the Usar management team have worked in all aspects of the home building process, including construction site work, home building material sales, spec home building and beyond. After having the opportunity to explore the many different avenues of general contracting, we’ve established that custom homes are our specialty because of our comprehensive skill set and experience in the industry.

To us, your home is a crucial component of your life. It's where you spend a large part of your day, and being able to have a role in choosing and designing the comforts you look for in a home is a way to enhance that daily experience.

Usar’s Five Phase Building Approach

PROJECT CONSULTATION
We will meet with you to find out exactly how we can help you build the home of your dreams. Using our more than 20 years of industry experience and your vision, we will work together to create a house that you and your family can make into a home.

BUILDING PREPARATION
We draft up the building plan to apply for the appropriate permits and permissions to build your home. Our experience in multiple different cities and municipalities has given us an advantage in pre-building preparation. Let us handle the paperwork so you can focus on the aspects of your new home that matter to you most.

INTERIOR DESIGN
Our friends at Inter-mind Design have won multiple Georgie and Ovation awards for their interior design excellence throughout British Columbia. Our partnership with them helps us provide you with experienced and knowledgeable design professionals who will make your new house a stylish, functional and unforgettable home. By having a specific interior design focus before building, we can ensure that the home will be created as the perfect canvas for your furnishing plans.

BUILDING PHASE
A structured process before building results in faster building times, more structurally sound houses, and reduced waste on production sites. We want you to love your custom home, which is why we have regular check-ins with clients during the building phase to ensure that project aspects are coming to life exactly as planned. Our experienced and talented staff allow us to offer luxury building services in Metro Vancouver and BC’s surrounding areas.

POST PROJECT CHECK-IN
We want to make sure that you are happy with the results once your custom home is completed. We meet with all of our customers after the building phase is finished to ensure that everything is in order and to see if there is anything else we can do to complete your dream home.
