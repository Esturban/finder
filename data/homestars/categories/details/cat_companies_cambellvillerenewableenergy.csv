As EfstonScience, we were science and technology specialists. As eSolar, we put that knowledge into practice. 

After 43 years of selling everything from telescopes and night-vision to beakers and science fair projects, EfstonScience is bringing the solar system to earth with our new solar and renewable energy installation business.  

EfstonScience has always been GREEN. Designed and built by The Efston's in 1981, the Science & Astronomy SuperStore included a passive solar heating system – way ahead of its time!
At the end of September 2012, we closed the retail store and changed our focus and expertise to our already established solar business. This is a natural evolution for our company since we have always sold solar products and now we have added services including design and installation of residential and commercial grid-tied and off-grid energy systems. 

Our knowledgeable and experienced Renewable Energy Team has expanded their expertise from traditional solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, to include hybrid systems that combine solar thermal, wind turbines with PV to provide complete solutions for your unique situation. 

Whether it’s an off-grid cottage or street or sign lighting system, or a grid connected system, eSolar solutions start by identifying the client’s needs in order to develop a comprehensive system design, select the optimal products, then manage the installation process to take you through a custom turn-key installation – hassle-free. We actively project manage all aspects of your system, including obtaining permits, contracts and licences.

To take advantage of the Ontario Government and Ontario Power Authority (OPA) incentives, we have developed a step-by-step procedure that simplifies the FIT and MicroFIT application process where we take care of all the paperwork for you. We will custom design a grid-tied system to meet your roof space and budget, while maximizing your income potential for a fast return on your investment. 

With access to all the major renewable energy component manufacturers, EfstonScience can select from the best products available including the latest technology such as Enphase micro-inverters that allow for very customizable installations with monitoring of each individual solar panel available for the best possible prices.

eSolar solutions combine turn-key integration and state-of-the-art technology with over 43 years of EfstonScience knowledge and customer service.
