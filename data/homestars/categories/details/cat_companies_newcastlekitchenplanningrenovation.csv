What began as a small rental unit on Bloor St. in Oshawa, has grown in size and tenure to the 9,000 sq ft warehouse we design from today. Our guests and repeat clients enjoy being greeted by Cheryl or Tony, before strolling through our showroom with a refreshment to gain inspiration from our many displays showcasing new products from the countries leading suppliers. Brandom takes great pride in offering a beginning-to-end approach as a team. Our clients will never find themselves shopping sections of department stores or sourcing tradespeople. Our experience has gained the confidence of many, and results in productivity while honouring our clients schedule and budget. We enjoy every step of the renovation process, from measuring and designing the space, to installing the cabinets, flooring, reworking plumbing, safely updating electrical needs, and as needed will remove walls, counters, backsplash, and dispose of all accumulated excess.

DIY's can be enticing but renovations by inexperienced contractors or labourers can quickly become expensive and stressful. 

Once a client has agreed to partner with us, our design team will present a 3D render of the discussed vision to be approved or amended, before any work commences in your home. We bring more than fifty years of aggregate experience ensuring an enjoyable, creative experience transforming their favourite space. 
In addition to primary design, our team is present for our clients during all facets of the installation, manufacturing processes and future service. 

Our team wouldn't be complete without our in-house installers who bring the design element to life with precision and care. Our installers consistently deliver excellence while showing the utmost care for remaining flooring and furniture. Installers are available upon request to revisit the site for services if needed. (All electrical and plumbing work is performed to code standards).

We are grateful for every new and returning client for making Brandom Durham's trusted design studio.

Call Cheryl today to schedule your first appointment. Our family is looking forward to working with yours!
