After growing up in a family owned Floor Refinishing business and seeing the pros and cons I wanted to do business differently, better. Because I became aware that as a home owner it can be a challenge to understand everything about the project you’re hiring for and to make the best decision for your needs.



I know as a home owner looking at a floor refinishing project you have concerns about the quality of the job, the time frame as well as the longevity of the finish so you can enjoy the beauty of one of the greatest assets of your home for years.


At NewRidge Refinishing we’ve learned and operate with the understanding that it’s not only how we start a project that’s important to you it’s also how we finish it.



NewRidge Refinishing is comprised of the best contractors in the industry that take pride in their trade, from the quality of machinery to the professional processes and the high standard for materials that are designed to give your floors a lasting finish.



We worry about all the details of preparation, protecting the area outside of the project, cleaning and completing so you can rest knowing that your job will be done as expected and on time.



We work with your general contractor if needed as well have recommendations should you need them to accommodate all of your project needs.



It’s great knowing what to expect and when to expect it when you choose NewRidge refinishing for your floor and stair refinishing needs.
