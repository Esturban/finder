Most duct cleaning companies are not NADCA certified, nor are they equipped with a truck that boasts a 300 HP vacuum.  They do not offer the expertise of certified technicians nor do they deliver the raw mechanical power required to effectively perform professional duct cleaning. <br/>

<br/>In fact, most companies have trucks mounted with a mere 24 HP Heat Seal vacuum, specifically designed for vans.
<br />Our equipment delivers 5 - 10 times more power than our competitors!!<br/>

<br/>When shopping for qualified and certified duct cleaning companies, be sure to compare apples to apples.<br/>
