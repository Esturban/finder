Do you need a Full Home Renovation, New Construction, Extension, Addition, Second Floor, Basement or Kitchen Renovation?

We begin with a Free Consultation in your Home. We want to learn about your current layout, design and structural features. We also want to know what you do and don't like about your home. Next our Designer will do an extensive brainstorming of possible designs, colour tones and layouts. She will put together a proposal and recommend what styles go well with your home and preferences. The planning and design is the most important part of a home renovation. 

Next we have a Contractor with over 40 years of construction experience in Toronto. He will look at all the structural changes, interior and exterior finishes etc. to calculate your construction cost. We work with you and make adjustments until you are satisfied with the scope of your renovation and budget. Everything is on paper, we do not touch your home until you give us your approval. 

We then put together a rigid timeline and schedule. Materials are sourced and contractors begin their work. To keep your money safe, we want to minimize up front deposits and pay progress payments only after each stage is completed. Our goal is to keep you informed throughout the entire process, whilst allowing you to focus on your daily work, family and social life.
