The company is owned and operated by Grant and Greg Dainty, third generation HVAC technicians.
Over the years, TWINTECH has developed an outstanding reputation for both the quality of our installations and high level of customer service in the Greater Toronto Area and surrounding areas.

Our History
Grant and Greg owe their business prowess to their grandfather, Tom Rodman, who perfected his skills in the sheet metal trade while working at the General Motor's plant in Oshawa before founding his own business, Rodman Sheet Metal, in 1949, during a time when sheet metal fittings were still produced by hand. Tom and his staff are responsible for the installation of hundreds of oil furnaces and duct systems in homes that were built across Ajax, Pickering, Whitby and Oshawa during the 1950s and 60s. Rodman Sheet Metal was eventually renamed to Rodman Heating.
In 1972, Greg and Grant's father, Ron Dainty, a certified Tool & Die Maker, joined the Rodman Heating team as a sheet metal apprentice. Ron expanded his skill set to include an expertise in oil and natural gas furnaces and central air conditioning. By 1975, Tom was ready to retire his tool belt, and handed the reigns of the business over to Ron. Under Ron's leadership, the company was once again re-branded, this time to reflect their new service offerings – Rodman Heating & Air Condition
Curious as youngsters, Greg and Grant grew up immersed in the family business. During the late 70s, they worked part time as summer students alongside their father. After graduating from college, the twins both took on full-time roles in family business, taking advantage of hands on learning in every aspect of the heating and cooling business. From the sweat and toil of the sheet metal shop producing custom duct work by hand, to the installing furnaces and air conditioners, to answering the phones and going on late-night service calls, they could do it all.  
When it was Ron's turn to retire and sell the business, Grant and Greg decided to translate their hands-on experience into a successful brand of their own, and so TWINTECH was born.
With over 30 years of experience under their belts and an unparalleled reputation for delivering superior service, TWINTECH has been able to develop and maintain the long-term customer relationships that make them the envy of the industry.",twintech-heating-cooling-inc,2015-12-21T15:43:56.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Furnace

Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

The technology was developed within the Indoor Environment Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose IAQ scientists tested it. The research was funded by US Environmental protection agency, US dept. of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and California Institute of Energy and Environment.

",infiniti-air-conditioning-heating-newmarket,2019-02-26T22:39:25.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,"MODULATING HIGH-EFFICIENCY FURNACE:

Is like highway driving, making slight operating adjustments while achieving maximum efficiency. This new condensing furnace with a modulating gas valve operates with more finesse to reduce temperature fluctuations, providing consistent indoor temperature, quiet operation, and an annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) of 97.4%.

​TWO STAGE HIGH EFFICIENCY FURNACE:

Unlike traditional furnaces that turn on and run at full capacity with each demand for heating. Two-stage furnaces start out by running in its first stage, which uses only about 68% of its capacity. This reduced capacity is sufficient enough to warm your home on those mild winter days. When the temperature outside drops, the furnace will meet the extra demand by adjusting to the second stage heating cycle.

Variable speed brushless DC motors:

Have intelligent technology that monitor incoming data from the blower and adjust accordingly so you can feel confident that your system is working to keep you comfortable. A DC motor uses substantially less electricity to move the same amount of air.

​ HIGH-EFFICIENCY NATURAL GAS FURNACES:

Also known as a condensing furnace, is the most efficient furnace available, because it provides your home with ideal heating comfort while using less energy than other models. High-efficiency furnaces are designed to extract additional heat from natural gas and, when they do, the flue gases condense, or turn to water - hence, the name condensing furnace.

​ CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONERS:

The efficiency of air conditioners is often rated by the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating of a unit, the more energy efficient it is.

Air conditioners with 14.5 seer rating and higher are eligible to receive government rebates.

​ FIREPLACES:

Either they are direct vent or inserts. Direct vent fireplaces are designed to be vented directly out the outside wall.

Inset fireplaces are designed to be inserted into an existing wood burning fireplace. A chimney liner is required to be installed with an insert fireplace.

HEAT RECOVERY VENTILATOR (HRV):

Can help make mechanical ventilation more cost effective by reclaiming energy from exhaust airflows. HRVs use heat exchangers to heat or cool incoming fresh air, recapturing 60 to 80 percent of the conditioned temperatures that would otherwise be lost.

​ TANKLESS WATER HEATER:

Tankless water heaters were once the wave of the future, but now they are gaining in popularity every day as homeowners and business owners alike discover the benefits of instant water heating technology. Takagi is a leader in the industry for the best in tankless water heating, and there are many units to choose from.
