I have over 20 years of experience in the industry. My background is in Architecture (I have Bachelor's degree) and I have worked in Architecture/ Interior Design firms for 20 years on high end retail projects and commercial office spaces. My unique combination of skills helps me understand and visualize the area you want to renovate on your home and inspires me to create an architectural space which is visually stunning, functional and within your your budget.

Although I have a variety of experience in the field, I specialize in creating comfortable, functional kitchens and bathrooms for new homebuyers. 

FAQ:

Q. Do you provide Interior Design or Interior Decorating services.
A. ACA DESIGN STUDIO provides Interior Design services.

Q. What is the difference between Interior Designer and Interior Decorator?
A. Interior Decorators typically provide services dealing with specifying and buying furniture, carpeting, wallcovering, drapery and various decorative items such as lamps, pillows etc. You do not need a degree or a license to be an Interior Decorator. Interior Designers must obtain a degree in Interior Design or in Architecture and must have a license in order to practice. Interior Designers go thru a rigorous training and years of practice in various aspects of design and construction. Some of their experience includes but is not limited to: space planning, furniture and millwork design, concept design, construction supervision, hiring and coordination of work with architects and engineers, construction management and coordination, knowledge of the building codes, filing for permits and materials specifications. Interior Designers can prepare construction drawings which include: demolition, new construction of walls, electrical layout, ceiling lighting layout, new millwork and furniture. Interior Designers can help you with the construction and renovation of the interior of your home or a commercial space. 

Q. What is your education and Interior Design experience?
A. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Architecture from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and I am licensed by CIDQ. My professional experience includes work on high end retail projects (Barney's New York stores, Versace Flagship store and residence in NYC, Polo Ralph Lauren boutiques), commercial projects (space planning and project management for an Insurance Company on Wall Street, renovation of office spaces in Toronto) and residential renovations for homes in Toronto.
If you would like to see the images of my previous work, please see my YOU TUBE video under PROJECTS tab- HOW I BECAME AN INTERIOR DESIGNER.

Q. How is ACA DESIGN STUDIO working during Covid lockdown.
A. As many of the Ontario areas are under strict lockdown or entering different stages of the reopening plan, ACA DESIGN STUDIO is now offering some services virtually thru ZOOM and FaceTime. There is a lot that can be accomplished virtually. Some projects will require that I take measurements on your space. If you are comfortable with me visiting your home, I would propose that I take measurements while you are in a separate space and after I am finished (and disinfected the items I touched) we meet outside to discuss the next steps or any concerns you have.

SERVICES which we offer DURING LOCKDOWN are:

Design Consultation- Virtual
Site Measurements
Renderings
Space Planning
Materials and FF&E research and procurement (Furniture, Furnishings and Equipment) by online search or showroom visit
Design Drawings
Construction Drawings

Q. What is the process of working on the project. 
A. Our first meeting is typically a Design Consultation which is now available (via Zoom) from the comfort of your home. During the consultation we will go over your expectations for the project, your lifestyle, preferences and likes, time line, budget as well as your inspiration images. I will then collect all that information and create a budget which is a fair representation of the work and send it to you for approval. 

If we decide to go ahead with the project, I would typically visit your home at this point (or space ) and take site measurements. During Covid-19, I would still prefer to take the measurements and photos myself (for accuracy reasons), so we can either arrange that I will do the work while you are in a separate room or we maintain a safe distance of 6 feet. I will be wearing a mask during the time I am in your home. 

After the initial meeting, and after we sign the agreement, there is still lots I can accomplish remotely. This includes work on renderings, concept package (including sourcing materials, finishes, equipment) and any design or construction drawings you need. We can also arrange to have samples sent to me and to you for review and approval.

As Toronto is under strict lockdown and construction work is still on HOLD, we will have to postpone on-site work until we move into the less strict color code. 

Q. Does ACA DESIGN STUDIO have a license to practice?
A. Yes ACA DESIGN STUDIO is certified by CIDQ (Council for Interior Design). https://www.cidq.org

Q. Are you insured?
A. ACA DESIGN STUDIO carries professional and liability insurance for all projects.

Q. What services do you  offer and how much do you typically charge for a project?
A. ACA DESIGN offers 3 packages of services: Design Consultation, Design Services and Design and Management Services.

Q. How does ACA DESIGN STUDIO compare with other Interior Design firms?
A. Agnieszka Chromicz is the founder of ACA DESIGN STUDIO. She hold a Bachelor of Architecture Degree from the prestigious Pratt Institute in New York. Her interest in design has been a driving aspect in all her ventures.  She got her first taste for high-end retail design work as a Junior Designer at MSM Architects in NYC, where she worked on Gianni Versaceâ€™s flagship store in Manhattan. With a subsequent 4-year stay at American International Group on Wall Street,  she added project management and space planning skills to her list.  

Agnieszka earned a Masters Degree in Design and Technology at Parsons School of Design in 2001. She returned to work as an Architectural Designer, first for Polo Ralph Lauren and later for Jeffrey Hutchison Associates. At JHA, she spearheaded millwork development and production for Barney's New York flagship retail stores in the Las Vegas Palazzo, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago locations.  

In 2011, Agnieszka relocated to Toronto, where she joined internationally renowned entertainment design company Forrec Ltd. As Senior Interior Designer, she led teams working on theme parks, retail complexes and resort projects in China and Saudi Arabia.  

in 2016, Agnieszka opened a small Interior Design Firm with a renovation of a converted peanut factory loft and then with several office renovations in downtown Toronto.

Drawing on her background in diversified fields and applications, Agnieszka uses the design process to transform spaces and create an inspiring experience. Her passion for developing and delivering the best vision for the project, makes her an exceptionally valuable partner on innovative design projects.
