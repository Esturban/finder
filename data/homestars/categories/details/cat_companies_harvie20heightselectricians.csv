Commercial Case Study: The Honest Electrician Helped Mountain Mercato in Canmore Stop Experiencing Power Interruptions While Using Their Induction Hot Plates
The specialty food market and café were constantly tripping their main breaker anytime they used their induction hot plates for cooking, which caused everything in the store to come to a standstill. Fed up with the problem, Mountain Mercato called The Honest Electrician to see if he could help. The Honest Electrician immediately recognized the issue; a previously installed 120/208VAC three-phase power system had been poorly balanced. The Honest Electrician spent two hours taking various readings, then moved some breakers around to better balance the system. Mountain Mercato hasn’t tripped their main breaker while using induction hot plates ever since.
