MAXgreen believes you should NOT have to replace your windows, siding, and roofing every 10-20 years if you DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.

MAXgreen believes everyone deserves EXPERT workmanship and a LEAK-PROOF and COMFORTABLE home FOR GOOD, and that your renovation experience should be enjoyable!

Our MAXcommunity program plants a tree and donates $10 to local charities for every Window and Door that we supply and install and $50 for every complete Roofing and/or Siding Project completed.  Half of which goes to our yearly charity of choice (this year it is the Calagry Food Bank), with the other half going to the customers' charities of choice.  It may not sound like much, but we have managed to raise over $100,000 through our MAXcommunity program in the last 6 years alone!

Over the last year we have built a team that is dedicated to client care.  We go above and beyond to eliminate problems we have seen so many home owners face; storm chasers, sales people who see dollar signs, trades that do not show up, unfair estimates, poor installations--these are just to name a few.

With over 35 years of combined experience in exterior installations, we have the privilege of offering the culmination of our skillsets, knowledge, experience and just old-school hard work. The best part is offering genuine customer service --something I believe a lot of people are missing these days.

We proudly offer a Lifetime Workmanship Guarantee with all of our installations. It is a privilege to be trusted with a person's home and we stand behind everything we install, offering a team that is committed to taking care of your exteriors.  One thing we do not offer is buyer's remorse.  In taking the solution-oriented approach with all of our projects, we want our clients to work with us because of who we are and what we can provide -- not because of a sales pitch.  What we deliver is something you will not come across very often in this industry.
