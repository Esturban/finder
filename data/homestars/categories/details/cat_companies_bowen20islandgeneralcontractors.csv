Usar is a custom home consulting and contracting company founded in 2004. We service the Greater Vancouver Area by offering a full-service custom home building solution, from concept to finished project.

Our vision is that by working with all aspects of the home building process, including architectural, construction and design professionals from the beginning, we can create a more seamless home construction experience and superior final product. We believe that wonderful homes get made when design and unique ideas meet solid technical and structural components.

Members of the Usar management team have worked in all aspects of the home building process, including construction site work, home building material sales, spec home building and beyond. After having the opportunity to explore the many different avenues of general contracting, we’ve established that custom homes are our specialty because of our comprehensive skill set and experience in the industry.

To us, your home is a crucial component of your life. It's where you spend a large part of your day, and being able to have a role in choosing and designing the comforts you look for in a home is a way to enhance that daily experience.

Usar’s Five Phase Building Approach

PROJECT CONSULTATION
We will meet with you to find out exactly how we can help you build the home of your dreams. Using our more than 20 years of industry experience and your vision, we will work together to create a house that you and your family can make into a home.

BUILDING PREPARATION
We draft up the building plan to apply for the appropriate permits and permissions to build your home. Our experience in multiple different cities and municipalities has given us an advantage in pre-building preparation. Let us handle the paperwork so you can focus on the aspects of your new home that matter to you most.

INTERIOR DESIGN
Our friends at Inter-mind Design have won multiple Georgie and Ovation awards for their interior design excellence throughout British Columbia. Our partnership with them helps us provide you with experienced and knowledgeable design professionals who will make your new house a stylish, functional and unforgettable home. By having a specific interior design focus before building, we can ensure that the home will be created as the perfect canvas for your furnishing plans.

BUILDING PHASE
A structured process before building results in faster building times, more structurally sound houses, and reduced waste on production sites. We want you to love your custom home, which is why we have regular check-ins with clients during the building phase to ensure that project aspects are coming to life exactly as planned. Our experienced and talented staff allow us to offer luxury building services in Metro Vancouver and BC’s surrounding areas.

POST PROJECT CHECK-IN
We want to make sure that you are happy with the results once your custom home is completed. We meet with all of our customers after the building phase is finished to ensure that everything is in order and to see if there is anything else we can do to complete your dream home.

Mission
Usar is a custom design-build contracting company that will custom design and build every part of your project. Usar will build a house that will become your home. Usar is growing into all different contracting levels and makes the finest custom homes and affordable homes for all communities. 

Vision
