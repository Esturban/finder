I use the latest techniques in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) such as proper inspections, and employ the least toxic pesticides required to solve the issue.
 
Passionate about working directly with people to solve problems, I launched Power Pest Control after obtaining a Structural Exterminator License from the Ministry of Environment, and spending a decade learning the business from the ground up at large pest control companies.
 
On a personal level, I’m a father of a young child, so I understand that nobody wants a pest problem in their home.  I use my knowledge and skills to make your home and family as safe and comfortable as possible, while dealing with pest issues effectively and quickly.
