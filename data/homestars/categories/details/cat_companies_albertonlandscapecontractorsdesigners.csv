Our Services:

***
Residential construction: This is our specialty. This is what we love to do and what sets us apart from so many other landscaping companies out there. Patios, driveways, retaining walls, poolscapes, small concrete pours, decks, fences. You name it and we've done it, and we won't be finished until you are 100% satisfied.

***

Commercial Construction: It may not interest the average Home owner very much that we do commercial construction, but it might be comforting to know that we are skilled at it. This type of work makes it necessary for us to have all the right insurance policies, training and management skills to live up to the high standards that city contracts require. 

***

Ice and Snow management: No one likes getting up in the morning and fighting through a foot of snow to get to their car or even to the front doors of their business. That's why we're here. When it snows we're out there cleaning it up no matter what time of day or night it is, and we don't stop till its clean curb to curb.",twenty-creek-landscaping,2018-03-28T13:52:33.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,,,,2016,8,"E-Transfer, Cash, Cheque",,,,TRUE,TRUE,,3500,TRUE,FALSE,2 Years,1975454,Twenty Creek Landscaping,15,15,24,9.93333,"Landscape Contractors & Designers, Landscape Contractor Designer, Landscape Design, Landscape Contractor, Landscapers, Landscaping, Landscape, Backyard, patio, Fountain, Ponds and Waterfalls, garden, gardens, landscape, how to landscape, landscaping and, landscape garden, garden landscape, gardening, landscape gardens, pavers, garden design, design a garden, design for garden, design garden, how to design garden, lawn maintenance, how to design landscape, design landscape, landscape and design, design and landscape, how to design a landscape, landscape design, design a landscape, patios, architects landscape, landscape architects, garden designs, lawn service, garden landscaping, landscaping garden, landscape lighting, garden designer, designer garden,,landscapemakeover of backyard and improve front yard
