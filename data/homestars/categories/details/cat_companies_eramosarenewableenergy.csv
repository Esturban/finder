We specialize in developing and delivering Solar Energy Systems that generate power for you, Battery Storage Systems to store that power, Backup Generator Systems to ensure you are prepared for emergencies, and Energy Management Systems that deliver power when and where you need it.  We connect all of your systems with our enhanced monitoring application that gives you complete visibility and control via an online portal with any web-enabled device.

Our approach is to partner with home and business owners who wish to take control of their energy requirements now, and we start by developing an energy plan that will protect you against rising energy costs, as well as keep you powered during increasingly chaotic weather events.  Once we have a good understanding of your requirements, we will create a custom solution for you, which can be implemented all at once, or slowly over time.  The important thing is that you will have a solid plan so that everything we do moves you closer to your goal.

In addition to providing the most reliable and reputable solar modules, inverters, and racking systems available today, Bluewater Energy is a licensed electrical contractor, certified Tesla Powerwall home battery storage dealer and installer, certified Tesla EV Charger installer, and accredited Generac generator dealer and service provider.  We integrate the most advanced technologies on the market today for your on-grid and off-grid energy requirements.
