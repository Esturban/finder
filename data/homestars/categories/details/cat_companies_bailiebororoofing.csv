Our expertise includes residential and commercial projects, maintenance and repair of existing roof systems, the installation of seamless gutters and advanced fastening systems and all types of custom aluminum and copper work.

Over the years, the reputation of roofers throughout the Greater Toronto area has suffered due to poor installers, the use of inferior quality materials, and the start up of fly-by-night companies.  It is our goal to revitalize the roofing industry's reputation, by providing the highest quality service and products for our customers.

We take your needs as seriously as you do.  From the smallest leak to a complete re-roofing project, we deliver the same professionalism, dedication and quality. We believe our service and quality provides our customers with piece of mind in knowing that the roof they are purchasing will provide superior weather protection today and for many years to come.
