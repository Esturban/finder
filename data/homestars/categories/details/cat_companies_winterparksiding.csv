We only use hangers no nails so you dont see the fasteners.2.We offer Smartscreen to be installed on new or existing eavestrough with a lifetime warranty.3.Aluminum Soffit and Fascia. Vented soffit is the best way to keep ice from building up on your roof. We make sure you have proper ventilation by opening your soffits to allow air flow in your attic space. The temperature in your attic should only be 2-3 degrees celsius different than the outside temp. This proper ventilation wont allow ice to build up. 4.Vinyl Siding installation. This can make any old house look brand new.This can be installed over existing to add an extra layer of protection or overtop of a house wrap, or foam insulation.This helps to keep moisture and drafts to a minimum. It also adds more R-Value to your home keeping it better insulated and air tight. This allows your house to maintain a constant temperature. It also keeps your heating and airconditioning bills down. 5.Capping. This will cover any wooden beams,window and door trims. You never have to paint again!
With all of these items done to your house you will have a maintenance free exterior.No cleaning of eavestroughs,no painting of walls,doors,windows etc,no ice buildup on your roof or walkways,and lower energy bills.This allows more money and time to spend with the family!
