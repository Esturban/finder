We make it easy for you to get the remodeling you need under one roof.


When one (exterior) door closes, another opens. We are a participating Green Ontario  Fund contractor!

In 2006, Jesse and Garth took a chance on the idea that two brothers with solid backgrounds in construction could build their own successful remodeling company.

Weaver started in Barrie, Ontario, as Accurate Aluminum Works (AAW). The company was made up of one idea, two skilled tradespeople, and a passion for running a professional exteriors company with a key focus on customer experience.

Their modern, systematic approach to doing business was something new to the construction industry in Barrie. Not surprisingly, things quickly picked up for the Dinans, and soon they needed to hire additional staff.

Eleven years later, with a staff of twenty (including office administration, a full-time sales team, and six full-time installation crews), Jesse and Garth have put down the tools and now spend their days operating their company, mentoring their employees, and altering their processes to ensure their customers consistently receive the best possible experience.

And their tools are never all that far away. As much as they enjoy growing a successful company, anytime one of their crews is shorthanded, it’s a race to see which brother can get out of the office first.


We keep our promises.

It’s a shame that our integrity sets us apart, but the truth is, our industry is fraught with broken promises and disappointed homeowners. We won’t stand for this. We’ve taken every effort to make sure the lines of communication between our team members and our customers are clear and that everything is documented each step of the way. We will not let a single detail fall through the cracks. Key team members are all aware of where each project sits and what the next step will be. Every one of our jobs flows through the same process. A process that’s been tried, tested, and proven to be true. We promise.
