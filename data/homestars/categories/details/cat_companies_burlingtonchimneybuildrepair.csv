We feel we can conquer almost any feat in this industry. In keeping with this mission, we offer a wide variety of services. No job is too big or small, as we treat each project with the same meticulous attention to detail.

Chimney liners
A chimney liner is the best protection to shield the chimney walls from heat and corrosion and direct the combustion products to the outside atmosphere. An aluminum or stainless steel chimney liner will extend the life of your chimney and provide your home with proper venting for your gas, oil or wood appliance. Chimney liners suffer damage from various sources, like chimney fires, house settling, water damage, and from natural deterioration. Older Toronto homes were built with unlined chimneys, and you would be amazed at how many people no longer use their wood fireplace because of smoke problems. If you light a fire and smell smoke in the basement or upstairs you have a serious problem which can be corrected with a chimney liner. Chimney liner installations should be performed by licensed contractors. We do chimney liners for wood burning fireplaces, gas burning appliances, oil burning appliances, and woodstoves.

Chimney rebuilds
Chimney rebuilds will help prevent the risk of fire, leaks and improve the overall look of your home. Chimney rebuilds can be partial or complete.

Chimney Repair
Chimney Repair involves removing the top 2 or 3 layers of the chimney. The top 2 or 3 layers of the chimney are usually the most weathered. Any loose cement between the bricks are then removed, so chimney is ready for re-grouting. The top of the chimney is then finished with a new concrete chimney cap and a new chimney flue. The cost for this particular chimney repair is 1/3 the cost of a chimney rebuild. This chimney repair, like all my chimney rebuilds, include a ten year guarantee.

Tuck pointing
Tuck pointing is very important to keep out water, humidity and moisture, preventing damage to the structure. By removing the old and damaged mortar and replacing it with new mortar a protective seal is formed, helping preserve the bricks from further damage and avoiding costly future repairs.

Brick Work
Brick replacement, repair, cleaning or sealing are all different ways to improve the look of your house, as well as offering better protection from the weather elements.

As a company we feel that our chimney rebuilds, most often from the roof up, is our greatest competitive edge.
