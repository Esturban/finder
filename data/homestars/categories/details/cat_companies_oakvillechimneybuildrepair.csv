Meet Brian Buttigieg...
A passion for the trade and the challenges that are thrown at him in the form of difficult projects is what has kept Brian working in this field for 30 years.

Brian's Masonry
The decision to expand the company was made after many years of practice in the field. The goal for Brian was to start a company that clients can trust and turn to whenever they have an issues or projects they would like to take on. All the highly skilled workers that work alongside Brian were chosen for having the same values and drive to constantly improve. Due to this we feel confident when saying we can help you with even the most challenging of tasks.


How We Prepare
We begin by detailing a several step plan of approach before starting anything else. This plan is looked over several times to ensure the steps can be followed precisely and swiftly.

Consultation
Your needs and requirements being met is our top priority. We want to make sure that you are satisfied and due to this, make sure to communicate the above multi step plan to you and confer with you along the way.

Safety
We very closely follow all procedures and guidelines set by the Ministry of Labour in the Occupational Health and Safety Guidelines as well as the Construction Requirements and Guidelines set both by the city and province. We ensure that neither us, the contractor, nor anyone else will be harmed or injured to the best of our abilities.

Practice What We Preach
We have done work from the basics to very intricate projects. We follow through all of the discussed plan, and check at the very end that it was followed very closely. We pride ourselves on making sure it is done with good quality materials and top quality workers.
