Hi, and welcome to Interior Climate Solutions!
My name is Nick Baker, and I am the founder of ICS. This company has grown far beyond my expectations and I couldn't be more thankful to my friends and neighbours for trusting me to service, and replace their HVAC systems to help keep the company up and running in the early days.
Now we are a small team of fully licensed technicians that have a combined 40 years experience in the trades.  We are registered with the Technical Standard Safety Authority and the Ontario Colleges Of Trades.
Our goal is to offer our customers a stress free experience in a high stress area of work. Having your furnace breakdown in the middle of winter, or your AC quit on you during our hot summer days can be a nightmare. Eliminate that stress by knowing who to call before it happens, and deal with a small company that is tailored to suit your every need. We have reduced prices compared to the big name companies, and offer a high quality product as well as a higher quality customer experience. 
In our business, the customer comes first, satisfaction is our guarantee, and we have a strong warranty to ensure that you feel confident in your choice to hire Interior Climate Solutions.

We look forward to working with you!

For new and existing homes we provide the experience, knowledge and friendly customer service to design, install, maintain and repair all types of heating systems. Specialize in hot water heating systems, we work with radiators, gas boilers, hybrid system, tankless water heaters, hydronic radiant heating systems (radiant floors) and solar heating. We also install natural gas furnaces.

At EXTEL Gas services Inc our service and knowledgeable installation technician will explain and help you choose the right air conditioning system to fit your home cooling needs.

We specialize in installing split system air conditioning systems, and ductless air conditioning systems. Call us for your home air conditioning (AC) needs and stay cool in the summer at a low cost.

We also provide HVAC Installation and Maintenance service for small commercial buildings or residential house. For new or existing buildings we can install custom sheet metal ducts that have been designed for your forced air heating and cooling needs, using quality air handlers, and natural gas furnaces that move air effectively and efficiently to maintain a consistent indoor environment for all seasons of the year.

Our company has helped those families during winter blizzards, as well as families on the other end of the spectrum, being stranded without a functioning air conditioner when it’s hot out in Toronto. In either situation, our customers just want the job to be done appropriately in an efficient manner. So, our standards aim to match those needs. We’re available every hour of the day for service calls, we have same-day service options and our technicians are prompt and reliable.

We also know that it’s not always exciting to spend your hard-earned dollars on HVAC, which is why our company works to make it affordable. With in-home cost estimates, you’ll know exactly how much you’re spending and what you’ll receive for that money. Additionally, your energy bills can go down after making sure that your HVAC Systems are as efficient as they can be.

If you have questions or comments about solutions we can provide, we urge you to give us a call at 416 849 7997 or schedule an appointment online. While you may be paying for an air conditioner, what you’re really receiving is peace of mind – and we’re happy to provide it for you.",extel-gas,2018-07-29T16:16:57.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Heating Installation & Service, AC Installation & Service, Gas Lines, Fire Places, Furnaces, Boilers, Hot Water Heaters
