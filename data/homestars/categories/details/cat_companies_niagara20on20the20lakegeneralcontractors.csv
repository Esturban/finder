Jeff has a passion for turning houses into homes and making his clients visions come to life.

As I grew up I was always fascinated in finding out the way things work, taking them apart and then putting them back together/ fixing them. I began my adulthood working in the construction field. I started off in concrete and then felt as if I wanted to learn more. 



I found that in my spare time I was meeting new people in the construction industry, asking questions and actually going out and learning new stuff. I became fascinated in the renovation field when I saw peoples dreams come true in their projects. I connected myself with some very important people who saw my potential and believed in me. I was noticing that for all the jobs I had worked at, I was basically the one in charge of making the decisions and running the project. 


My bosses always had trust in me to make the decisions when they weren’t around. This is when I decided that I have so much responsibility, I do great work and it was time for me to take leadership and pride in my own work 100%.. so why not start my own business?
