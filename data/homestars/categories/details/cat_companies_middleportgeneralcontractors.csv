Paul and his team are committed to a professional process, full transparency, and the very highest quality possible.

We’re with you at every phase of the renovation, from the initial planning and materials selection, to buildout, to finishing and even after the fact, if you have details you’d like to add.

Although we are a small team, this works in our favour as we are able to really give hands on training to new employees and build our experience and knowledge as a team at a pace that works for each individual. 

Since opening in 2020, we have gained experience in decks, fences, flooring, fireplace accent walls, stairs, and many home renovations that involve reframing and drywalling, bathrooms and kitchens.

THE COLLECTIVE CONNECTION PROCESS
We created The Collective Connection Process™ based on our experience working with thousands of clients over many years. We’ve learned that some people do not achieve the best outcomes with their interior designer or contractor because they did not connect first with what they really wanted emotionally. We call this The Disconnected Design Trap™. When you fall into this trap, you waste a lot of time and money, feel stressed, and worried and ultimately do not achieve your vision. This is why we created The Collective Connection Process™.  To get a better outcome, we learned it's important to connect first with what you really want emotionally. By engaging in a Collective Connection Conversation you are taking the first step to avoid the Disconnected Design Trap.  You will feel more relaxed and confident. And you will achieve your vision.
