Proudly serving clients in the GTA and surrounding areas. 
DSM Property Services is proud to provide our clients with professional, reliable inspection services. All our inspections are conducted by a qualified and fully accredited Registered Home Inspector (RHI) and Certified Thermographer with over 25 years experience in construction and renovation. Our inspection services include:
•	Detailed Inspection of all visible structures and components of a home,
•	Infrared thermal scans* of non-visible structures and components to detect potential issues with moisture, electrical, and insulation  
•	Use of the latest Inspection Technology
•	Repair and cost estimates
•	Recommendations and Maintenance planning
•	A fully detailed and easy to read report of all findings including pictures for quick reference
•	A reference library and links to more detailed information on the components of the home
You also have the option to purchase a detailed Home History Report.
 *Infrared Thermal Scans are part of our premium package and are conducted to detect what the naked eye cannot. This process can identify potential problems in structure, electrical components, insulation, air leakage and moisture content.
An Infrared Scan can:
•	help locate potential safety issues with live electrical equipment, 
•	detect hidden heating and cooling losses, 
•	detect moisture intrusion which could cause mould, 
•	detect inadequate or non-existent insulation, 
•	detect plumbing leaks and poor construction.
•	It could save you in potential repair costs!!
Book a thermal scan inspection:
* Before a warranty inspection
* Before a Real Estate Investment
* Before a contractor begins work
* After a completed project
* As part of a routine maintenance check on your home.

Doing your homework on finding the right Home Inspector is crucial. You need to make sure you are hiring a qualified and experienced Inspector. After all, this person will be providing you with the information you need to make an informed decision about some very costly investments, whether it be the purchase or selling of a home, a new home renovation or existing repair, maintenance of your existing home or potential issues you are having.
We hope that DSM Property Services Inc. can help you with your inspection needs!

As part of your community, we are pleased to provide our local customers real estate professionals, home buyers and home sellers with a home inspection service that brings to the buying or selling of a home unmatched quality, precision, integrity, and professionalism.

We call what we do The Moment of Truth. It is the moment when the emotion of buying and selling a home meets the reality of the issues of that home. Our work is to communicate effectively, knowledgeably, efficiently, and openly about the condition of a home. We understand that our customers trust us to inform and educate them about what we see and what we find, and this is a trust we hold in the highest regard.

Real estate professionals
For real estate professionals, our work is a commitment to the understanding that their reputation is our responsibility and that a relationship with us reinforces the confidence their clients have in them.

Home buyers
For the home buyer, our work is an objective explanation of the condition of the potential new home to which an emotional tie is already being formed.

Home sellers
For the home seller our work is to honor the home they have lived in, and to report on its condition observed at the time of the inspection.

For all of our customers, Pillar To Post considers the home a place of the heart, as it houses the people that are loved and the memories of lifetimes. This is why we call Pillar To Post The Home of Home Inspection.


What’s Included In My Home Inspection?
Your Pillar To Post inspector will examine all structures and major systems of a home. They will identify important factors for you to consider as you make your home ownership decision. Your home inspector is always happy to answer any questions you have during the inspection.

Owner: Dano Burnett

I am the proud owner/operator of a Pillar to Post Home Inspections franchise that serves Toronto and Scarborough.  My experience in the construction and HVAC industries has spanned over 10 years.  To know me, is to know I am a very hard-working, humble, passionate and direct person.  I believe that I can help educate home buyers to fully understand what they can expect with their investment.  This should be a fun and informative process that is interactive and refreshing.  No home is perfect, but every situation has a solution and I pride myself on helping illustrate this to my customers.
