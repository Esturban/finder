Whether you are a Homeowner involved in remodeling, renovating or retrofitting your home, or an Industry Professional or Contractor looking for a reputable insulation contractor for your next project, we can deliver reliable and prompt service at a competitive price, using only the highest quality Canadian-manufactured cellulose insulation on the market today. 
With the cost of living skyrocketing, saving money by saving energy has never been more important. Heating and cooling costs can account for 50-70% of a home or building’s yearly energy expense. When installed correctly, insulation is the simplest and most cost-effective means to lower this energy use. Remember, sealing and ventilating your home correctly will not only keep you warm in winter but will also cool you down in the summer months… Insulation is the perfect four season solution to saving you money.
If you are working on a “Green Building” project, or consider environmental sustainability a factor in your decision-making when selecting an insulation installer, please contact us. We choose to install Climatizer Plus™ cellulose insulation for its superior thermal and acoustical performance as well as its environmental benefits. Climatizer Plus loose-fill cellulose is certified by UL’s ECOLOGO program; indicating that this product has undergone rigorous scientific testing, auditing, or both, to prove its compliance with stringent, third party, environmental performance standards and may help you contribute to LEED credit categories.   
Call us or “Get started today” on our website and allow us to provide you the information you need to make an informed choice for your home or building insulation needs.  We offer free in-home assessments and quotes.

Chris worked closely with Joe growing up, working on furnaces and the farm since a young age. Chris learned a hard work ethic at a young age. His first word was Grandpa, and he always heard Conrad around the house. And decided to ask Joe what’s a Conrad, where he said a hard worker and someone that gets the job done. That always stuck with Chris.

Chris took Conrad into another direction, Carpentry. Instilled with the Conrad heritage and hard work ethic. Chris started his apprenticeship right after highschool, Taking his time to learn the trade and craft. Chris received his diploma and finished his training as a Licensed carpenter in may 2013. Chris then decided to carry the family name and started Conrad Construction and Design Inc on June 18th 2013.
