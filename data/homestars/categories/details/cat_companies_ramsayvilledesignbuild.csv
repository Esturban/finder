They love taking something that appears old and worn out and bringing it back to its original character while giving it a modern touch.


Justin has been in the construction industry for more than 15 years. He started out as subcontractor for a local business, building custom homes, apartment complexes, and condominiums. During this time, he also started his own business in which he renovated and constructed properties. He was also able to deconstruct and start from the bottom up.



Meanwhile, Katie remained at home to raise their four children. She admits to becoming wildly obsessed with HGTV, Pinterest, and home design. Then 2 and a half years ago, they took their love for home design further by purchasing an old Victoria house that was on the verge of ruin. They restored it back to its original character and added modern flairs.


Justin’s talent for building and Katie’s eye for design were their motivations in establishing their own home design business. They look for homes that need design improvement and revamp them while keeping the original characteristics of the property. For them, what is considered by some as a lost cause may still be transformed into something beautiful, homey, and comfortable.",jk-house-of-design,2019-01-26T14:25:36.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,Home Building Major Additions Basement Renovations Kitchen Renovations Bathroom Renovations,,,2008,6,"Cheque, E-Transfer",,Real Estate Agent,,TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,FALSE,,1988953,JK House of Design,1,1,14,10,"Design/Build, Contracting, Renovation, Remodeling, Restoration, Project Management, Renovation Assistance, Reno Management, architect, architects, design build, build & design, design and build, build by design, design to build. building construction, building a house, house designs, house plans, home designs, house plan, how to design a house, design house, house design, remodeling, building and design, design for building, design building, building by design, a building design, design of building, building design, design a building, building & design,  playsets, playground, wooden playset, wooden playground, play set, ,",0,2019-01-26T14:25:58.000-05:00,jkhouseofdesign,FALSE,0,0,15,0,FALSE,f1566e533eac2d5cd833b14ed6fcd8576af48805,TRUE,NA,TRUE,FALSE,2222237,76.9642857143,458,NA,NA
