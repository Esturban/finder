​Gas fireplaces and furnaces need annual maintenance to ensure safe and proper operation! 


All of the components that make up a gas fireplace or a furnace need to be inspected, tested, adjusted, & cleaned annually in accordance with manufacturer specifications. This is to ensure that the unit is operating safely and efficiently. 

A gas fireplace annual maintenance consists of: 

A series of inspections, tests, and adjustments to ensure the safe efficient operation of your gas fireplace 
Cleaning all components of your fireplace. 
Replace ""Glowing Embers"" which will enhance the flame and give your fireplace a warm and inviting glow. 
Touch up paint to parts that look worn, or dull.​​ 

A gas furnace maintenance consists of; 

Combustion analysis to get an accurate output efficiency reading of your furnace. This will ensure proper combustion set up and maximum efficiency of your furnace. 

Carbon monoxide test of the heat exchanger to ensure no cracks that would allow poisons exhaust fumes into living area. This test is important because carbon monoxide is a colourless, odorless and extremely deadly gas. 
Standard filter replacement (16*24*1   high performance filter) or if your filter is reusable then a filter maintenance would be performed. 

Visual inspection of furnace and all furnace components
