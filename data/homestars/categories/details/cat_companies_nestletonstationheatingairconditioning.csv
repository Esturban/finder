The company is owned and operated by Grant and Greg Dainty, third generation HVAC technicians.
Over the years, TWINTECH has developed an outstanding reputation for both the quality of our installations and high level of customer service in the Greater Toronto Area and surrounding areas.

Our History
Grant and Greg owe their business prowess to their grandfather, Tom Rodman, who perfected his skills in the sheet metal trade while working at the General Motor's plant in Oshawa before founding his own business, Rodman Sheet Metal, in 1949, during a time when sheet metal fittings were still produced by hand. Tom and his staff are responsible for the installation of hundreds of oil furnaces and duct systems in homes that were built across Ajax, Pickering, Whitby and Oshawa during the 1950s and 60s. Rodman Sheet Metal was eventually renamed to Rodman Heating.
In 1972, Greg and Grant's father, Ron Dainty, a certified Tool & Die Maker, joined the Rodman Heating team as a sheet metal apprentice. Ron expanded his skill set to include an expertise in oil and natural gas furnaces and central air conditioning. By 1975, Tom was ready to retire his tool belt, and handed the reigns of the business over to Ron. Under Ron's leadership, the company was once again re-branded, this time to reflect their new service offerings â€“ Rodman Heating & Air Condition
Curious as youngsters, Greg and Grant grew up immersed in the family business. During the late 70s, they worked part time as summer students alongside their father. After graduating from college, the twins both took on full-time roles in family business, taking advantage of hands on learning in every aspect of the heating and cooling business. From the sweat and toil of the sheet metal shop producing custom duct work by hand, to the installing furnaces and air conditioners, to answering the phones and going on late-night service calls, they could do it all.  
When it was Ron's turn to retire and sell the business, Grant and Greg decided to translate their hands-on experience into a successful brand of their own, and so TWINTECH was born.
With over 30 years of experience under their belts and an unparalleled reputation for delivering superior service, TWINTECH has been able to develop and maintain the long-term customer relationships that make them the envy of the industry.",twintech-heating-cooling-inc,2015-12-21T15:43:56.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Furnace
