As your Home and Mold Inspector,  Ambicorp Property Inspections look beyond the aesthetic attributes of a home and inspect for defects or deficiencies that may lead to costly repairs in the future.  I conduct a full inspection of the property's interior and exterior.  There is no pass or fail on a home inspection, rather a thorough report of any defects observed, indicating the condition of the home and the resulting recommendations to the client.  As my client, you will have the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on your biggest purchase and investment and the place that you will call home.

    Lab Results Obtained the Next Day - A detailed lab report is provided the next day for Mold Inspections.  In addition to taking mold samples for laboratory analysis, we also do Indoor Air Quality Testing to check for the presence of mold spores in the air.  Samples are sent to our PRO-LAB partners in Vaughan and samples are analyzed for the presence of mold, lead or asbestos.  The lab report details the species of mold, the spore concentration and any known health problems or allergic reactions that may be associated with the mold.   Some people have allergies to pets such as dogs and cats, while others have allergies or concerns about cockroaches, rats, mice and dust mites.  Did you know we also test the air for allergens?  Contact us​ for more details.

Proudly serving clients in the GTA and surrounding areas. 
DSM Property Services is proud to provide our clients with professional, reliable inspection services. All our inspections are conducted by a qualified and fully accredited Registered Home Inspector (RHI) and Certified Thermographer with over 25 years experience in construction and renovation. Our inspection services include:
•	Detailed Inspection of all visible structures and components of a home,
•	Infrared thermal scans* of non-visible structures and components to detect potential issues with moisture, electrical, and insulation  
•	Use of the latest Inspection Technology
•	Repair and cost estimates
•	Recommendations and Maintenance planning
•	A fully detailed and easy to read report of all findings including pictures for quick reference
•	A reference library and links to more detailed information on the components of the home
You also have the option to purchase a detailed Home History Report.
 *Infrared Thermal Scans are part of our premium package and are conducted to detect what the naked eye cannot. This process can identify potential problems in structure, electrical components, insulation, air leakage and moisture content.
An Infrared Scan can:
•	help locate potential safety issues with live electrical equipment, 
•	detect hidden heating and cooling losses, 
•	detect moisture intrusion which could cause mould, 
•	detect inadequate or non-existent insulation, 
•	detect plumbing leaks and poor construction.
•	It could save you in potential repair costs!!
Book a thermal scan inspection:
* Before a warranty inspection
* Before a Real Estate Investment
* Before a contractor begins work
* After a completed project
* As part of a routine maintenance check on your home.

Doing your homework on finding the right Home Inspector is crucial. You need to make sure you are hiring a qualified and experienced Inspector. After all, this person will be providing you with the information you need to make an informed decision about some very costly investments, whether it be the purchase or selling of a home, a new home renovation or existing repair, maintenance of your existing home or potential issues you are having.
We hope that DSM Property Services Inc. can help you with your inspection needs!
Please visit our website and our Facebook page for regular updates on home inspection and construction information!

Make the right decision in your biggest life investment.  Let me be your eyes and ears! 

We provide home inspections for buyers, sellers, and owners. Our primary goal is to acquire and retain satisfied customers by placing their concerns foremost. For our home-buying clients, we want to help them make a well-informed decision about one of their most important investments. To achieve this, we aim to put in proper perspective everything we call out so that serious items are highlighted and routine items do not cause undue alarm. For our home-selling clients, we want to help them present their house in the best possible light. Our pre-listing report identifies areas to be addressed ahead of time, and it can also be shown to prospective buyers as a way to assure them that there aren't any hidden surprises.

We are very thorough and do not cut corners. We tend to spend more time at the site than our competitors. Our reports are also thorough and complete, with clear and extensive details. We like to think of our reports as a kind of owner's manual for your home.

You can count on us to be professional, courteous, and open-minded; to pay meticulous attention to detail; to display a calm demeanor, a high standard of integrity, and a spirit of fairness; and to listen carefully to the client's concerns.

A typical  Themal Home Inspection on a 2000 sq. ft. home usually takes about 1 hour minimum. This includes the actual thermal scan, obtaining both... the Infrared and digital images, then carefully interpreting and explaining our findings to you. You also have this time to consult with us as to ""How you can properly correct deficiencies that are located with the thermal Imaging"". Then all of the thermal images will be compiled into a professional and detailed report and emailed to you within 3  5 business days.
Pricing for this example is $250 minimum
