The Authorized Contractor Program boasts that only the best Electrical Contractors are current members - only those Electrical Contractors who do consistent, code-compliant work, are allowed on and are permitted to remain on, the Program.

The Electrical Safety Authority is the authority responsible for public safety in Ontario. ESA is working to ensure that electrical installations in Ontario meet the Code requirements of the Ontario Electrical Safety Code. This Code requires that an application for inspection be filed with ESA for electrical installations and wiring done in your home or business facility.
