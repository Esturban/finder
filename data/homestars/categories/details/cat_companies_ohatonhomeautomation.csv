Enjoy the peace of mind and control that comes with TELUS SmartHome Security.

Protect Your Home and Family
Keep an eye on what’s happening in and around your home in real-time, no matter where you are, with Indoor and Outdoor security cameras. You can also view recorded videos as well. 

Smart locks let you lock and unlock your door right from your smartphone. So whether you are leaving the house, or just climbing into bed, you never have to wonder if you forgot to lock the door.

Answer your door even if you’re not home, with a Wi-Fi doorbell camera. You can see and speak with whoever is at the door, even if you are at work or on vacation. 

You can get help when you need it - with 24/7 professional monitoring, you’ll get notifications if unexpected events occur, and our security experts are ready to send emergency services if needed.

Control Your Home with Your Voice or Smartphone
From your smartphone, you can use Amazon Alexa (with TELUS Home Assistant) or Siri to turn on your lights, warm up or cool down your home, arm your SmartHome security system, open or close your garage door, and so much more. 



Save Money on Insurance
According to The Electronic Security Association website alarm.org,  you can save up to 20% on home insurance with a professionally installed 24/7 home monitoring system. 

You can also save up to 6% on your heating bill with smart home automation devices - like a smart thermostat. Better for your wallet and mother nature.


Flexible Installation Options
You can do it yourself - self-install your system on your own time with our online guidance. Or we can do it for you - our professional technicians will safely install your order.
