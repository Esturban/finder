Let us tell you a little bit about our crew and how we came to be. 
RTA Landscape and pools started as a side hobby 30+ years ago. The owner, Rei, worked for the largest construction company in Canada since he was 17 and fell in love with the industry immediately. He worked for other large family run companies and dabbled in different areas of construction. However, with a drive for success, extreme work ethic, and precision he chased after a second dream on the side. Rei found a love for landscape and began his journey that has now led him to where he is today; running the most TRUSTED landscape and pool company serving York Region & The GTA.
