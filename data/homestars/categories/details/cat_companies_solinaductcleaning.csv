Ductwise Duct Cleaning and it’s expert team will get your home, business OR industrial space feeling clean again and you’ll breathe a breath of fresh air when we’re finished.
Continuously Circulating Dust

You might not realize how much dust accumulates inside the ducts just from your everyday life. Multiply this amount of dust by years and years inside your home and you quickly have a major dust problem. Any time air circulates through the ducts it pushes this dirt around, which irritates your system, especially if you are already prone to allergies. You cannot get relief from this dusty air until the ducts are cleaned.

An Ideal Breeding Ground for Mold

Another serious issue to be on the lookout for within your air ducts is mold. The dark, often damp interiors of your ducts create a premium breeding ground for mold. If not properly cleaned, this mold can lead to serious respiratory irritants for you, your family or your employees. Mold is especially dangerous for young children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.

Unseen Vermin and Insects

Without regular cleanings, your air ducts could be susceptible to rodents and insects that further pollute the air you breathe and lead to bigger issues with allergies. Call in the professionals today to give you an air duct cleaning that gets rid these issues and helps you breathe easy whether you're at home or at work.
Your ducts are breeding grounds for rodents, dust mites, mould and other nasal irritants that can lead to allergies and other respiratory conditions.

The truth is (for the most part) if your ducts breathe it, you breathe it.

With brand new state-of-the art equipment, Ductwise will leave the interior surfaces of your home, commercial or industrial space bright and shiny, for your the wellbeing of your family or employees.

Make Ductwise a necessary part of your home or company's maintenance plan. Your lungs will thank you for it.

The Process:
1) The process begins with the connection of a large vacuum hose (8 inch diameter) into the return section of the duct work.

2) The entire ventilation system is then sealed, covering all supply and return grills to allow for a powerful and concentrated suction.

3) High pressure air (250 psi) is then forced through each and every return vent and continues until all return main duct trunk lines are properly cleaned.

We use a wide array of air cleaning tools, such as air whips, brushes, reverse and forward air flow jesters (air snake) to loosen or break up all caked on dirt, dust and debris from the interior surfaces of all duct lines. This process is then repeated through the supply section of the ventilation system and continued until all supply vents and main duct trunk lines are properly cleaned .

We handle all aspects of residential, commercial and industrial HVAC duct cleaning.  From our inception, we have always ensured that quality has been the focal point of our business, building a highly credible reputation for exceptional service throughout the industry.  All of our work is performed by highly trained experienced technicians that are put through a rigorous training program before being allowed into the field, thus ensuring nothing but professional service and results coupled with an excellent work ethic and a genuine care & concern for the customers' property.  We use state of the art equipment, combined with effective cleaning tactics to attain those optimal results.  We pride ourselves in being air system cleaning specialists and a member of the Better Business Bureau with an exceptional A+ rating. 

Award Winning Service
 
       Customer satisfaction is extremely important to our success.  this becomes evident with a high volume of customers being either repeat clients or referrals.  Our customers have shown their satisfaction year after year as we have been voted the Readers Choice Award winner twice as the best air duct cleaners in this category.  We use high powered vacuum trucks and state of the art equipment with an effective cleaning process to attain optimal results.  Our uniformed technicians are always polite, highly knowledgeable in the indoor air quality industry and are fully insured and bonded to give our customers additional peace of mind.  We promise that you will get award winning service, first time, every time.  Try us once and you too will be telling your family and friends about our exceptional air duct cleaning service and will never again look for another duct cleaning company. 

Proof of Work
 
           Your satisfaction is airtight guaranteed with our indoor air quality control program.  We provide a visual or digital camera inspection of the existing air duct conditions with the customer present and after the work has been completed to validate right before your eyes that the duct cleaning process was done to your complete satisfaction.  It is important to note that very few companies will offer their customers an inspection service so they can see what the ducts are holding before the work begins, and what they look like after the service is finished.  A huge red flag concerning the quality of work they would conduct should go up if the company you are speaking to about air duct cleaning does not provide this very important inspection service.  We do it every time, and it's free!  Seeing is believing is how we satisfy our customers, and we even offer free photos of your ducts, both before and after, so you know the job has been done right. 
    

 We Do Not Telemarket

 
 Double Diamond Air Duct Cleaning does not engage in any form of unsolicited telemarketing practices.  We never have, and we never will.  We will never use a third party to conduct telemarketing either.  If you receive any unsolicited phone offers for air duct cleaning services from anyone claiming to be affiliated with, or employed by Double Diamond Air Duct Cleaning, be forewarned - they are not who they claim to be.  Furthermore, we, along with other reputable air duct cleaning firms, are taking steps to eradicate these telemarketers, and appreciate your patience while we work to put and end to these irritating and false practices.
