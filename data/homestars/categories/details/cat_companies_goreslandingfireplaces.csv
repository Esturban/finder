Natural gas leak detection and repair:
Natural gas and propane pipelines, equipment and appliances should be inspected for maintenance every two years or immediately following home improvements or reconstruction. Safety concerns range from asphyxiation to fire, and gas leaks have an immediate impact on the cost of fuel.

Homeowners, business execs and plant managers can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier natural environment by maintaining natural gas and propane systems regularly. Controlling GHG emissions leads to health, safety, environmental and economic benefits.

Garage heating systems:
Garage gas heaters make the workplace more useful and comfortable. In Canada, natural gas heaters are needed towork year-round. The most efficient system is usually a gas-fired, forced-air unit heater. Portable kerosene or propane heaters require ventilation, adding to the system complexity and safety considerations. 

Restaurant natural gas systems:
Natural gas is a popular choice for restaurants and other establishments that require cooking facilities including natural gas-fired fryers, griddles, ovens, and hot and cold storage areas. A natural gas system is economical, dependable and easy to use. Heating a restaurant with natural gas provides comfort to customers and saves money. Grills, deep fryers and exhaust systems, however, present a fire risk if not properly cleaned and maintained. Regular inspections by a CGS crew will reduce risks and show where efficiencies may be found.

The natural gas industry has transformed into one of the most technologically advanced industries. Natural gas appliances are also rising in popularity due to their efficiency and cost effectiveness. Although many natural gas-powered appliances are initially more expensive than their electric counterparts, they are commonly much cheaper to operate, have a longer expected life, and require relatively low maintenance. Other natural gas appliances include generators, space heaters, clothes dryers, pool and jacuzzi heaters, indoor and outdoor fireplaces, barbecues, garage heaters and outdoor heaters and lights. All of these appliances offer a safe, efficient, and economical alternative to electricity or other fuel sources. The same natural gas pipes that supply gas to a furnace can be used to supply energy for all of the appliances listed above, making installation simple and easy.

Natural gas fuel cells and microturbines both offer the residential consumer the capacity to disconnect from their local electric distributor, and generate just enough electricity to meet their needs. Although this technology is still in its infancy, it is very promising in being able to offer independent, reliable, efficient, environmentally-friendly electricity for residential needs
