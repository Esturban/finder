Assembly Services was founded in 2001 by the entrepreneurial vision of Dean Dawkins, the companyâ€™s present CEO. Identifying a gap to be filled, Deanâ€™s vision was deceptively simple: to provide courteous and efficient assembly services to both corporations and individuals, encompassing everything from interior and exterior furnishing to a wide array of outdoor products. Over the last 12 years, Assembly Services has therefore evolved in two distinct directions, (1) assembling display/floor models for the companyâ€™s corporate partners, and (2) providing assembly services to individual clients, through referrals and word of mouth. With over 12 years experience, Assembly Services currently has retail/corporate and individual accounts throughout South-Western Ontario, encompassing Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, Stratford, Guelph, the GTA and surrounding regions. We have established ourselves as a strong competitor in the service industry by focusing on affordable and high-quality assembly services. We provide furniture, appliance and equipment assembly in both home and office settings, with an average of more than 1,000 service calls each year and growing. With a client-centred mandate and a strong emphasis on customer satisfaction, our team is composed of honest, reliable, hardworking, and dedicated individuals to meet your assembly and installation needs.
