Assembly Services was founded in 2001 by the entrepreneurial vision of Dean Dawkins, the company’s present CEO. Identifying a gap to be filled, Dean’s vision was deceptively simple: to provide courteous and efficient assembly services to both corporations and individuals, encompassing everything from interior and exterior furnishing to a wide array of outdoor products. Over the last 12 years, Assembly Services has therefore evolved in two distinct directions, (1) assembling display/floor models for the company’s corporate partners, and (2) providing assembly services to individual clients, through referrals and word of mouth. With over 12 years experience, Assembly Services currently has retail/corporate and individual accounts throughout South-Western Ontario, encompassing Kitchener-Waterloo, Cambridge, Stratford, Guelph, the GTA and surrounding regions. We have established ourselves as a strong competitor in the service industry by focusing on affordable and high-quality assembly services. We provide furniture, appliance and equipment assembly in both home and office settings, with an average of more than 1,000 service calls each year and growing. With a client-centred mandate and a strong emphasis on customer satisfaction, our team is composed of honest, reliable, hardworking, and dedicated individuals to meet your assembly and installation needs.
