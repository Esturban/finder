CLEAResult is the largest provider of energy efficiency services in North America. We help utilities and governments run energy conservation programs that help business and homeowners save on their bills and increase their building or home's comfort, all while reducing their impact on the environment. Our mission is to change the way people use energy.

- What We Do -

Our energy advisors provide home audits that give you a chance to understand your home in a new light. During the audit, we'll walk through your home, taking pictures and notes of its dimensions, construction materials, and mechanical systems. We'll also perform a blower door test to determine how much air your home leaks. We use this information to breakdown your home's energy use, give it an official energy rating and give you a report on which energy efficient upgrades you should consider for your home.

Our advisors are also able to help you use your audit to apply for up to $5,600 in rebates on qualifying energy-efficient upgrades through Canada's Greener Homes Program and Enbridge's Home Retrofit Program, as well as local and federal zero-interest home loans for energy efficient upgrades (Greener Homes Durham, Toronto Home Energy Loan Program, Better Homes Kingston, Better Homes Ottawa)

- What an Audit Can do For You -

Financing - Get access to rebate programs and home upgrade loan programs
Make your home cozier - Pinpoint home comfort issues at the root so you can permanently address them
Lower your bills - Understand your energy use and what kind of home upgrades can help slash your bills
Ease your environmental impact - A more energy efficient home is much gentler on our planet
Increase property value - Find out which upgrades can give your home an excellent energy rating. Getting your home labelled as energy efficient lets potential buyers know its worth a premium. 

- Book an Audit - 

We have friendly staff ready to answer your questions and get you on track to a more comfortable, more valuable, and energy efficient home. You can get in touch by calling 1-888-688-1220 or e-mailing homeauditing@clearesult.com. 

We're looking forward to being your energy partner!

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA. Our professional, courteous team members will assist you with every step of the process, ensuring complete satisfaction in our services.
