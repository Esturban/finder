As your Home and Mold Inspector,  Ambicorp Property Inspections look beyond the aesthetic attributes of a home and inspect for defects or deficiencies that may lead to costly repairs in the future.  I conduct a full inspection of the property's interior and exterior.  There is no pass or fail on a home inspection, rather a thorough report of any defects observed, indicating the condition of the home and the resulting recommendations to the client.  As my client, you will have the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on your biggest purchase and investment and the place that you will call home.

The lab report details the species of mold, the spore concentration and any known health problems or allergic reactions that may be associated with the mold.   Some people have allergies to pets such as dogs and cats, while others have allergies or concerns about cockroaches, rats, mice and dust mites.  Did you know we also test the air for allergens?
