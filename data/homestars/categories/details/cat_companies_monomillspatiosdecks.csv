ROYAL Decks Co. focuses on specialty materials, such as exotic hardwoods, low maintenance materials and high grades of cedar. <a href=""http://www.royaldecks.ca"">ROYAL Decks Co.</a> offers a complete solution for a homeowner from custom designs to the execution of the project. 

ROYAL Decks Co. was founded in Burlington Ontario and quickly grew to serve all surrounding areas of Toronto and also Calgary since 2008 onwards. We are successful because we take every deck builder project as if it was the only one, although we build hundreds each year. 

Our success is based on the following five core values:

Great design
Quality work
Build on time and budget
Provide great warranty
Safety

<i>Great design</i>
In order for the deck to be great, it has to be usable, look great and fulfill all of the customer's expectations. With our extensive experience, we will work with you to design the deck that will serve the purpose, according to your needs. This means getting the right size and shape of the deck, getting the right features and selecting the right materials. We work with many materials of different properties and we are sure to find one that will work for you.

<i>Build quality</i>
We have only the most experienced carpenters. Our carpenters have been in construction most of their lives and they build decks not because they have to, but because they love it. All of our decks have to meet very strict ROYAL Decks Co. quality control on top of any building code requirements. Our decks not only meet building code, they exceed it.

<i>Build on time and on budget</i>
Our estimate includes time frame when the project will be started, how long it will take and how much exactly it will cost.  We strive to make the construction process an enjoyable experience. That is why we take these extra seriously.

<i>Provide great warranty</i>
We are proud to give one of the best warranties in the business to every deck that carries ROYAL Decks Co. name on it. We stand behind the work that we do. To see details about our warranty please visit our warranty website.

<i>Safety</i>
Safety is our utter most requirement doing any work. We carry both WCB and WSIB, to date without a single claim. We keep our workplace neat and organized to minimize any injuries.

We began operating in April of 1992 after buying assets from Wrisco Ltd. Wrisco was a major supplier of aluminum patio covers, enclosure material and awnings for over 30 years. For 17 years we operated from the old Wrisco location, a 32,000 square foot facility in the Toronto suburb of Markham. In February of 2009, we moved to our current custom designed, 40,000 square foot facility in Ajax, Ontario (just East of Toronto).

Craft-Bilt’s main business is contractor sales of sunrooms, railing, waterproof decking, awnings and patio covers. We manufacture railing kits, canopy kits and sunroom kits. Our line of retractable fabric shades includes: fabric awnings, motorized screens, free standing canopies and canopies for pergolas.

We take a great deal of pride in the engineering behind our products. Proper engineering is important for obtaining building permits. You will find that Craft-Bilt products exceed the industry standard.

Our sales are primarily to customers in Canada. If you are interested in sunrooms or shade products in the USA, please contact Craft-Bilt Manufacturing Co. in Pennsylvania. They have been producing sunrooms in the United States for over 40 years.
