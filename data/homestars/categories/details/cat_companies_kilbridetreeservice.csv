Ever had that nervous feeling when you're shopping for expert services and you aren't sure who to trust? 
We've had it when our car needs service or when our furnace breaks down. But how about your tree work?

Nine years ago, I started a tree company that set out to provide customers with enough information that they can make an informed decision plus the technical know-how to get the work done safely and efficiently. 
So far we've succeeded.

Preserve Trees & Improve Life....
The preservation of trees improves not only our quality of life, but also the lives of generations to come. When you stop to appreciate a vibrant healthy tree, full of life and energy, your spirit is rejuvenated. Trees not only beautify our surroundings, they clean the air and minimize the need for storm water retention, through transpiration in relation to their leaf surface. Trees provide homes and food for wild life, and are a major contribution to our environment. They also provide shade, noise reduction, shelter, and help increase significant energy savings by protecting our homes from the suns heat.",arborwood-tree-service-inc,2015-04-17T20:18:17.000-04:00,NA,NA,,"Arborganix

Pruning - Often, trees are pruned for building, pedestrian, sidewalk, and utility wire clearance. Other times they are pruned for in order to improve the structure of the tree and reduce the risk of future failures. When pruned properly, trees will maintenance free for several years. Topping is not an advisable form of pruning as they will cause damage and hinder future growth and possibly create a hazardous tree later on, also increasing the cost of future maintenance.

Removal - When ​trees are diseased, badly damaged or otherwise in decline they can pose a safety hazard to your family and surrounding neighbours, structures, fences and other landscape features. We can help you make an informed decision on whether or not to retain or remove a tree.
 
Cabling - Cabling is a form of preventative maintenance for trees to help add strength to flaws in the structure and reduce the risk of future failures during severe weather. We can help you decide which method of cabling is suitable for your trees.
 
Tree Planting - Spring and summer is the best time to plant trees. Especially during cooler spring months that offer plenty of rain. Careful consideration of placement and which species of tree are areas that we would love to help you with. Young, newly transplanted trees should get lots of water at regular intervals.
 
Stump ​Grinding - ​Removal of old and new stumps for future landscaping is recommended.
