Hi, and welcome to Interior Climate Solutions!
My name is Nick Baker, and I am the founder of ICS. This company has grown far beyond my expectations and I couldn't be more thankful to my friends and neighbours for trusting me to service, and replace their HVAC systems to help keep the company up and running in the early days.
Now we are a small team of fully licensed technicians that have a combined 40 years experience in the trades.  We are registered with the Technical Standard Safety Authority and the Ontario Colleges Of Trades.
Our goal is to offer our customers a stress free experience in a high stress area of work. Having your furnace breakdown in the middle of winter, or your AC quit on you during our hot summer days can be a nightmare. Eliminate that stress by knowing who to call before it happens, and deal with a small company that is tailored to suit your every need. We have reduced prices compared to the big name companies, and offer a high quality product as well as a higher quality customer experience. 
In our business, the customer comes first, satisfaction is our guarantee, and we have a strong warranty to ensure that you feel confident in your choice to hire Interior Climate Solutions.

We look forward to working with you!
