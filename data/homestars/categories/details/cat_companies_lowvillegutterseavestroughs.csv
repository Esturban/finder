Trades by Jack is proud to offer this fantastic product to help you. Avoid the messy work involved in dealing with your gutters and eavestroughs.

Say goodbye to the dangerous and unpleasant job of climbing up to your roof to clean out your gutters once and for all, without the expense of paying someone else to do it.

Gutters capture the rainwater from your roof and carry it safely to the ground, away from your foundation, where it can cause serious damage. Ordinary gutters capture leaves, twigs and other organic debris that causes them to clog and overflow during rainstorms.

 •LeafGuard’s patented design causes rainwater to flow around its curved hood and into the gutter, keeping leaves and debris out.
 •LeafGuard Brand Gutters are guaranteed not to clog for as long as you own your home, or Gutter Depot will clean your gutters for free.
 •LeafGuard Gutters are made to fit any home in a variety of colours. Best of all they are made out durable materials, designed to last as long as you have a roof.
