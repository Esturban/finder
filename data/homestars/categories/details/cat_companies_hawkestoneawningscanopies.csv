We began operating in April of 1992 after buying assets from Wrisco Ltd. Wrisco was a major supplier of aluminum patio covers, enclosure material and awnings for over 30 years. For 17 years we operated from the old Wrisco location, a 32,000 square foot facility in the Toronto suburb of Markham. In February of 2009, we moved to our current custom designed, 40,000 square foot facility in Ajax, Ontario (just East of Toronto).

Craft-Bilt’s main business is contractor sales of sunrooms, railing, waterproof decking, awnings and patio covers. We manufacture railing kits, canopy kits and sunroom kits. Our line of retractable fabric shades includes: fabric awnings, motorized screens, free standing canopies and canopies for pergolas.

We take a great deal of pride in the engineering behind our products. Proper engineering is important for obtaining building permits. You will find that Craft-Bilt products exceed the industry standard.

Our sales are primarily to customers in Canada. If you are interested in sunrooms or shade products in the USA, please contact Craft-Bilt Manufacturing Co. in Pennsylvania. They have been producing sunrooms in the United States for over 40 years.
