It’s a craft I learned ‘on-the-job’ working for my Father’s landscaping company. The first contract was to install cabinets for a general contractor. Word soon spread about the company's work ethic, and our service offering expanded to interior trim, framing and siding. By 2005, we needed to hire full-time employees to help him deliver our services to an ever expanding list of satisfied clients. Our reputation attracted designers and builders of higher-end homes from across Toronto, the GTA and York Region.
Evergreen Carpentry now enjoys a reputation as the go-to option for contractors, builders and homeowners when they want top quality trim and siding products and workmanship. But many things remain the same as when Aaron decided to take that first job:

Our roof refurbishment process

The customer selects ‘Shingle’ which refers to the “Asphalt shingle”. Most of our roofs are used in this process. Previously mainly used a triple old fashioned tile. What is the latest process using an Architectural for 30 years? First of all, to remove the previous tile on the roof, you discovered that Shingle is just the “skin” of the roof, and there is a layer of Underlayment below it. “paper”. It is mainly used for waterproofing. Like Shingle, the paper and Shingle are already firmly glued together. In addition, there are chimneys and vents on the roof. There are waterproof boards under them. The name Flashing is linked to Paper and Shingle. Therefore, it is also necessary to “eradicate” together. After shovelling it off, the bone on the roof is left. It is a deck. The wooden boards on the roof are also divided into solid wood and plywood. If any rotten boards are found and there are holes in the boards, they must be replaced or replaced first. Then go in the opposite direction and begin to spread new paper on the board. In order not to let the rain drop down the eaves, we will install a drip rim “Drip Eidge” along the eaves. Then start Shingle from the bottom of the eaves. From bottom to top, from the right to the left, a piece of cloth, this is a repetitive work, meet the vents, to replace the flashing. Finally, the completion of the Ridge cap was nearly completed. Also note that in addition to paving tiles neatly, the main job is nailing, which is to hit the nails. The nails are good enough to play T deep and play tight. The most prone to problems are the protruding roofs, double inspections of the exhausts and chimneys, the cleaning of roof tile sinks after the replacement of roof parts, and the ground cleaning. Completing the photo shoot of the roof after the completion of the old and new contrast and key waterproof pictures send text messages to the owners to stay at the end of ten years of maintenance.

What refurbishment roof package?

It is a kind of roof roof total cost calculated by calculating the total roof area X using the number of roof tiles. You can measure your own roof quotation by yourself.

What are the advantages compared to ‘traditional roof renovation’?

The owners and practitioners who have experienced renovation of the roof know that the roof is a very complicated, high-risk system project. During the construction process, some consumers can avoid non-direct revenue costs.
