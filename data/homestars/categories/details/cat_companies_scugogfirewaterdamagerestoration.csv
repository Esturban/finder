Our IICRC-certified technicians go the extra mile to help you recover during this difficult time. Our goal isn’t just to remediate your property, but restore peace of mind.

Customers in the Oshawa area and beyond count on us for start-to-finish water damage restoration, smoke and fire remediation, and mould removal that’s thorough and performed safely. We provide services to Greater Oshawa, Oshawa, Port Perry, Courtice, Scugog, Bowmanville and Newcastle area residents and businesses.

After a flood, we respond quickly with advanced equipment and “rapid structural drying” techniques to remove water and draw moisture from the affected area. We also restore water-damaged furniture, carpeting, rugs, personal belongings and keepsakes. Our fire damage restoration teams make sure your damaged area is secure and safe from the wind, rain and snow, then we carefully perform tear-out, remove soot and smoke odour, and rebuild as necessary to get you up to code and back to normal.

We also provide professional deep-cleaning services. Clean carpets, area rugs and upholstered furniture can really restore the look and feel of your home. Our steam-cleaning methods remove stubborn stains, dirt and debris and prolong the life of the fabric. Our air duct cleaning services will restore the indoor air quality, so you can breathe easier. Don’t let dust and allergens that can build up in your air ducts contaminate your home.

Home restoration services you can count on when you need it most of all.
