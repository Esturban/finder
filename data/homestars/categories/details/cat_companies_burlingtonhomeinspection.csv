HOME ASSURE PLUS is an exclusive set of eight services offered by 4Sight Inspections and is included with every Home Inspection at no extra charge. You will not find this level of commitment or confidence in Home Inspection Service anywhere else.

A sample of what HOME ASSURE PLUS provides:
Re-visit*
If repairs are negotiated as a direct result of the inspection performed and the inspection report provided by 4Sight Inspections we will revisit the property at your request and at a mutually convenient time to re-inspect the contractually repaired components to ensure the repair is complete and satisfactory.

Walk-a-way***
If there are major concerns found with the inspected house that cause you to walk away from the purchase agreement I will inspect the next home you place an offer on at half price. i.e. if second home had a rate of $375 then you would only pay $185.

PRE-LISTING
							
Eventually, your buyers are going to conduct an inspection. You may as well know what they are going to find by getting there first. Having an inspection performed ahead of time helps in many other ways: 

-It allows you to see your home through the eyes of a critical third-party. It helps you to price your home realistically. 
-It permits you to make repairs ahead of time so that defects will not become negotiating stumbling blocks later. There is no delay in obtaining the Use and Occupancy permit. 
-You have the time to get reasonably priced contractors or make the repairs yourself if qualified. 
-It may encourage the buyer to waive the inspection contingency. It may alert you of items of immediate personal concern, such as radon gas or active termite infestation.
