Anne Sluman is the owner and lead designer of Refined Staging & Interiors. Anne's love of design, decorating, colour and her attention to detail make her a valuable asset to any home staging or design project.

Anne actually left the industry for many years, for several different reasons and ended up getting into accounting.  Talk about going in a different direction!  Anne worked for a global hearing aid manufacturer for 10 years and continued to work part-time helping client's with their decorating and staging projects, but didn't make it a priority.  A few years ago she and her husband thought about moving. It was during the process of seeing houses with their realtor that Anne's interest and passion for design, decorating and home staging was reignited!

Anne knew in her gut that it was time to return to the business, or would regret it for the rest of her life.  ​Anne quit her job and Refined Staging & Interiors was born.  Anne is so excited and motivated to help her clients love their home or sell their house for top dollar!
