The following is a VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
 
DISCLAIMER
BY PUBLISHING THIS PUBLIC MESSAGE  EXPECTS 
NO OBLIGATION TO BUY FROM TOTAL SECURITY CO
THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
NOT MEANT TO DISCREDIT ANY COMPANY 
 
Several alarm companies only have SUMMER PROGRAMS? They rent houses and hire large crews of university students which are offered large commissions ($400 to $500 per contract)to get you to sign up.
 
LEARN MORE by Googling ""door to door alarm scam"".
 
The PRESSURE:
Sales person won't leave even when you tell them to ""Leave""
Sales person won't leave when you tell them ""No Thanks""
Sales person won't leave when you say ""I Already Have Your Products or Service""
Sales person name drops the name of your neighbor and makes it sound like ""they signed up"" or ""they bought one"" or ""they referred me to you""
Sales person comes to the house several times and won't leave you alone
Sales person offers cheap cameras /chances to win vacations/free groceries for a year .....anything to ENTICE YOU TO SIGN THE CONTRACT
Once the system is INSTALLED you will be LIABLE for the FULL AND COMPLETE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ( typically 3 years or more)
EARLY TO TERMINATION OF CONTRACT IS LEGALLY REFERRED TO "" breach of contract"" and customer is more than likely to pay early CANCELLATION CHARGES amounting to over $700 + THE FULL VALUE OF THE CONTRACT 
Failure to. pay could result in collections , small claims and NEGATIVE REPORTING to the Credit Bureau 
 
The SOLUTIONS:
Put Up Your Hand and ""Say NO"".
Immediately close the door and the sales person will eventually leave.
Tell them ""You are Trespassing"" and that you are calling the BBB Better Business Bureau, Consumer Protection Branch and the Police if they do not leave.
BBB 1-888-352-7601, Consumer Protection (Local office)
Always Get 3 Quotes for whatever you consider purchasing. This gives you the time to gather information and to check if the ""deal"" being presented to you is the best option.
Look up reviews posted on social media such as HOMESTARS TWITTER FACEBOOK ETC.
Never Accept Quick Delivery of a product or service. This gives you a cooling off period and more time to gather facts.
If you did proceed with the offer You Have 10 Days to Change Your Mind and CANCEL (and get a full refund). It's the Law in Ontario (Consumers Protection Act)
Create Awareness and Share on Social Media as referred above.
Contact the local media

We've been in businesss since 1985 and have assisted thousands of homeowners, designers, builders & renovators with a variety of window treatments and soft furnishings.  Our designers and staff have years of experience AND a passion for what we offer our clients.

Shop by Brand, Hunter Douglas, Shade-O-Matic, Elite, Graber, MaxXmar, SunGlow, Altex, Eclipse, and more. Complete custom drapery with 4000+ designer fabrics, Unlimited styles and price ranges all expertly tailored and installed. And a huge selection of custom drapery hardware and motorization options.

***

WHO WE ARE - over 35 years in the window covering business

We do one thing, and we do it Really, Really Well.

Our DRAPERY SPECIALISTS and workroom can create any soft fabric treatment.  Our showrooms carry a huge selection of designer drapery fabrics for our clients to choose from.  Many of our drapery clients come to us after we have provided 'functional' window treatments in their homes or in their friends home and others have found our showroom on their own.

MAXXMAR offers some of the most innovative and well priced window treatments in the marketplace today.  We offer the full line of MaxXmar window fashions at prices our competition can't beat.

HUNTER DOUGLAS:  We have been a Hunter Douglas dealer for over 20 years.  Both of our showrooms are SHOWCASE SHOWROOMS meaning you will find every Hunter Douglas product on display with staff who can explain every Hunter Douglas option and our volume pricing ensures that it will be unlikely you will find a lower price on you Hunter Douglas Manual and PowerView shades.

SUNGLOW:  Specializing in the manufacturing of Sunscreen roller shades for residential and commercial applications, we offer SunGlow to our clients who are looking for oversized shades not available from Hunter Douglas, Elite or MaxXmar.  Their experience in Somfy motorization, linked shades, height and width makes them one of our key suppliers for commercial and condo applications.

ELITE WINDOW FASHIONS:  Since 1967 this Canadian company has been offering a wide selection of quality window coverings.  Well priced with fabrics similar to Hunter Douglases offerings, including e-motion and Somfy motorization.

MOTORIZATION  We have been selling, installing and programming motorized shades and drapery long before it became an entry level option for automating window coverings - 35 years to be exact.  Knowledge AND experience is an absolute necessity and all of our staff and technical installers are trained.  Not only will the shades be properly installed but also programmed and integrated into a variety of smart home systems.

Our sales approach is one of collaboration.  Our staff is hired for their ability and trained to spend enough time with the client to fully understand their expectations, needs and budget.  Then we can suggest options and allow the client to make the value decision for themselves.

We spend the extra time with each client to ensure they are choosing the right product that will provide solutions to their needs.  We try our best to balance privacy, light control with the right product that fits within the clients budget.

All in all I strive to make the environment and experience as stress-free as possible for my staff and clients.

Stephen Poxon

A home automation system will monitor and/or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things (“IoT”).

A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central smart home hub (sometimes called a “gateway”). The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.

Protect Your Home and Family
Keep an eye on what’s happening in and around your home in real-time, no matter where you are, with Indoor and Outdoor security cameras. You can also view recorded videos as well. 

Smart locks let you lock and unlock your door right from your smartphone. So whether you are leaving the house, or just climbing into bed, you never have to wonder if you forgot to lock the door.

Answer your door even if you’re not home, with a Wi-Fi doorbell camera. You can see and speak with whoever is at the door, even if you are at work or on vacation. 

You can get help when you need it - with 24/7 professional monitoring, you’ll get notifications if unexpected events occur, and our security experts are ready to send emergency services if needed.

Control Your Home with Your Voice or Smartphone
From your smartphone, you can use Amazon Alexa (with TELUS Home Assistant) or Siri to turn on your lights, warm up or cool down your home, arm your SmartHome security system, open or close your garage door, and so much more. 



Save Money on Insurance
According to The Electronic Security Association website alarm.org,  you can save up to 20% on home insurance with a professionally installed 24/7 home monitoring system. 

You can also save up to 6% on your heating bill with smart home automation devices - like a smart thermostat. Better for your wallet and mother nature.


Flexible Installation Options
You can do it yourself - self-install your system on your own time with our online guidance. Or we can do it for you - our professional technicians will safely install your order.

Save Money on Insurance
According to The Electronic Security Association website alarm.org,  you can save up to 20% on home insurance with a professionally installed 24/7 home monitoring system. 

You can also save up to 6% on your heating bill with smart home automation devices - like a smart thermostat. Better for your wallet and mother nature.


Flexible Installation Options
You can do it yourself - self-install your system on your own time with our online guidance. Or we can do it for you - our professional technicians will safely install your order.
