Top this off with friendly, knowledgeable service, an efficient delivery fleet, Air Miles, and our own rental center and you have a building supply partner that is second to none.

We've been in business for 145 years, and through this time, we've learned many valuable lessons on how to offer good service. We know it's about price, it's about timely delivery, it's about having enough stock on hand to meet your orders, but more importantly, it's about people. 

Come talk to Camille Robichaud, (Fourth Generation) or Daniel Robichaud (Fifth generation) about your next construction project. We have a great staff of trained professionals would be pleased to help you in whatever project you are planning. 

To tour U.J. Robichaud TIMBR Mart is to walk through time as one visits our Flour Mill, and our Custom Woodworking Shop. The Woodworking Shop, still in use today, uses the same table saws and planers that came with the building in 1905, and yes, they are still belt driven.

But we're not just about the past. We have a modern delivery fleet, complete with boom deliveries. We have a state of the art computer system that tracks our inventory, and allows us to make real time decisions to ensure we are in control of our products and our pricing. 

Our two stores, Meteghan Centre and Church Point are here to serve you.  Let us know what we can do for you. Both stores have their own uniqueness that make them special, they are not duplicates of each other.  Our Meteghan Centrestore is our operation hub, with the bulk of our building supply inventory as well as our delivery fleets. Our Peter Kohler Designer Windows and Doors showroom is located at our Meteghan Centrestore. Our Church Point store is designed for more retail and hardware although it does carry a core assortment of building supplies. You'll find our specialty Kitchen and Bath showroom at our Church Point store.

We are a strong supporter of Acadian Culture, and fly the Acadian Flag proudly on our many buildings. We believe that companies can be successful within Acadie, and operate without compromising the values that our ancestors struggled to preserve.
