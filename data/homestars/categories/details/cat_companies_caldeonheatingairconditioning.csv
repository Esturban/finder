Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA. Our professional, courteous team members will assist you with every step of the process, ensuring complete satisfaction in our services. Our goal is to exceed expectations every day.",heatpumps-ca,2021-07-09T14:07:34.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,"Mr. Slim MSY, Mr. Slim MSZ, H2I Hyper Heat, Zuba Heat Pump ","Ductless heat pump installation, maintenance, and repair",Mitsubishi Electric ,Ductless heat pumps,NA,NA,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,,2019898,HeatPumps.ca,8,7,8,10,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Green Products & Services, Green Product, Environmental Services, Energy audits, environmental audit, energy efficiency, environmental remediation, water purification, waste audit, Green products, green services, green cleaning products, go green products, eco friendly, environmentally friendly, products green, green services, green shopping, products environmentally friendly, recycled products, environmentally friendly products, eco friendly house, sustainable products, environmentally friendly house, eco friendly home, eco friendly homes, earth friendly, environmentally friendly home, environmentally friendly homes, eco companies, environmentally friendly products, sustainable product, ,",0,,FALSE,0,0,9,0,FALSE,57069c45cc221ba3e3fef06e0d87d4c88408489a,TRUE,2021-10-28T14:31:34.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2281061,87.2407469122,376,NA,NA,2021-07-09T14:11:39.000-04:00
