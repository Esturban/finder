Our Services:
1) Installation services for builders and contractors:
We supply and install windows and doors from Window Wise certified manufacturers.

2) Installation services for windows and doors companies and manufacturers:
Windows and doors companies and manufacturers face several points of pressure. You need to cater to the volume of requests received as well as meet deadlines that might often be unreasonable.
In such situations, a reliable contractor, who can take the responsibility of professional installations off your hand, can be a blessing. At Window Experts, we realize that and we will be happy to assist you with any and all types of window-installations, including:

Brick to Brick installation (Vinyl Windows/Aluminum Windows)
Retrofit/Frame to Frame installation (Vinyl Windows)
Bay to build/Bow to build (with roof/with skirt)
Sliding Doors (any type of standard/custom)
Entrance Doors (Steel/Vinyl/Wood/Fiberglass)
Garden Doors (Steel/Vinyl/Wood/Fiberglass)

3) Inspection services:
The need to conduct regular window inspections has been, increasingly, receiving the recognition it deserves. Be it commissioned by regulatory authorities, builders/ contractors, or requested by homeowners themselves, inspections offer a window of opportunity to identify issues before they occur. The issues, in turn, might result in a loss of finances, time or health.

Take, for instance, the case of humidity. Condensation and frost that collect on the surface of poor quality windows can permeate and create moisture, inside homes. This will, in turn, have ramifications on inhabitants’ lung health, in the long run.

This is why, inspecting windows before purchasing them or signing with a contractor, is strongly recommended. Windows Experts offer independent inspection services for companies and clients who had already replaced their windows or doors, but have questions or concerns.",window-experts,2017-01-09T10:14:51.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,"Vinyl WIndows
