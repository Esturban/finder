We were founded on the principles of excellence, quality, and trust. With our high-quality, efficient, and affordable services, we offer our clients the best value for their hard-earned money

OUR MISSION
To ensure that every property owner in Ottawa can not only afford to protect their foundation, but also to have access to Ottawa’s best parging group.

OUR VALUES
We value each of our clients and we will do everything to satisfy you!

OUR VISION
To become the undisputed leader of all parging companies in Ottawa.

BRIEF HISTORY:
In hopes of a more prosperous future, Cosimo Repaci immigrated to Canada from Italy approximately 50 years ago. While he had little more than the shirt on his back to start, his strong work ethic earned him an apprenticeship with one of Ottawa’s best parging companies.

After mastering the trade and perfecting his craft, Cosimo founded Tirenio Cement & Stucco LTD, whose name is inspired by the Tyrrhenian Sea, in 1970’s.

As a direct result of his solid people skills and outstanding skills, Cosimo quickly became Ottawa’s go-to man for parging and stucco services. Not surprisingly, he secured contracts with most of Ottawa’s leading builders — Caivan Communities, Cardel Homes, Claridge Homes, Mattamy Homes, Omega Homes, Phoenix Homes, Richcraft, Urbandale — and proudly served tens of thousands of satisfied customers before he retired and passed down his business to his eldest son Vincenzo Repaci.

Since taking over his father’s business, Vince has continued to build on his father’s legacy and cement Tirenio Parging LTD as the undisputed parging leader in the Ottawa region. In addition to securing new partnerships, he has significantly increased the efficiency of operations. Under Vincenzo’s leadership, his 7 member crew do over 5000 new homes per season.",tirrenio-cement-stucco,2022-04-27T14:34:53.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,"PARGING:
