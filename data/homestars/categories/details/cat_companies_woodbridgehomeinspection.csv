We are on here to allow the people who have used our services to tell you how we are doing. The hundreds of Classic Home Inspections reviews are from REAL CUSTOMERS.  We at Classic Home Inspections think the purpose of Homestars is to tell you what people think of us, not to tell you how we think we are.

As my client, you will have the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on your biggest purchase and investment and the place that you will call home.

The report contains colour photos of the defects, colour illustrations and the resulting recommendations.  The report also contains helpful links to online articles for your reference.


    ​​The Latest Home Inspection Technology ​- For home inspections we use the latest non-invasive technology, tools and instruments, including Thermal Imaging, SpectoScope, Moisture Meter, Combustible Gas Detector, Laser Thermometer, Hygrometer, Boroscope, Electrical Testers, Voltage Detectors among other tools. We inspect all major components of the home from the exterior to the interior.

​

    Lab Results Obtained the Next Day - A detailed lab report is provided the next day for Mold Inspections.  In addition to taking mold samples for laboratory analysis, we also do Indoor Air Quality Testing to check for the presence of mold spores in the air.  Samples are sent to our PRO-LAB partners in Vaughan and samples are analyzed for the presence of mold, lead or asbestos.  The lab report details the species of mold, the spore concentration and any known health problems or allergic reactions that may be associated with the mold.   Some people have allergies to pets such as dogs and cats, while others have allergies or concerns about cockroaches, rats, mice and dust mites.  Did you know we also test the air for allergens?  Contact us​ for more details.

Proudly serving clients in the GTA and surrounding areas. 
DSM Property Services is proud to provide our clients with professional, reliable inspection services. All our inspections are conducted by a qualified and fully accredited Registered Home Inspector (RHI) and Certified Thermographer with over 25 years experience in construction and renovation. Our inspection services include:
•	Detailed Inspection of all visible structures and components of a home,
•	Infrared thermal scans* of non-visible structures and components to detect potential issues with moisture, electrical, and insulation  
•	Use of the latest Inspection Technology
•	Repair and cost estimates
•	Recommendations and Maintenance planning
•	A fully detailed and easy to read report of all findings including pictures for quick reference
•	A reference library and links to more detailed information on the components of the home
You also have the option to purchase a detailed Home History Report.
 *Infrared Thermal Scans are part of our premium package and are conducted to detect what the naked eye cannot. This process can identify potential problems in structure, electrical components, insulation, air leakage and moisture content.
An Infrared Scan can:
•	help locate potential safety issues with live electrical equipment, 
•	detect hidden heating and cooling losses, 
•	detect moisture intrusion which could cause mould, 
•	detect inadequate or non-existent insulation, 
•	detect plumbing leaks and poor construction.
•	It could save you in potential repair costs!!
Book a thermal scan inspection:
* Before a warranty inspection
* Before a Real Estate Investment
* Before a contractor begins work
* After a completed project
* As part of a routine maintenance check on your home.

Doing your homework on finding the right Home Inspector is crucial. You need to make sure you are hiring a qualified and experienced Inspector. After all, this person will be providing you with the information you need to make an informed decision about some very costly investments, whether it be the purchase or selling of a home, a new home renovation or existing repair, maintenance of your existing home or potential issues you are having.
We hope that DSM Property Services Inc. can help you with your inspection needs!

At Home Inspections 4U we offer you  various types of inspections to protect you from getting into the money pit. Your home inspection will be conducted by a <b>Certified Master Inspector</b> and a <b>National Home Inspector</b> with engineering background and more than 10 years of full time experience in the home inspection field.<br> 
You can find a variety of home inspectors and a wide array of prices for their services. Some even offer you discounts or have ""monthly specials"". Much like in a Wall Mart. But you are not buying a pair of underware. You are hiring a professional consultant to give you an advice on a lifetime investment. Will you trust the cheapest guy in town with the biggest investment in your life?<br>
Remember: <b>""You always get what you paid for""</b>.<br>
<b>Tips</b> for selecting a good home inspector from the article in Toronto Star:
 
<b>Do your homework:</b> Ask savvy people for recommendations and settle on an inspector before getting caught up in the stress of buying or selling. Inspectors should have serious experience in the building trades, errors and omissions insurance, and, at the very least, <b>Registered Home Inspector, National Certificate Holder or Certified Master Inspector</b> credentials.
 
<b>It's no warranty:</b> Some have sued successfully when inspectors have been wildly inaccurate about a home's structure and mechanicals, and the costs of necessary repairs. But inspectors can't break holes in walls or peel shingles and siding from a house. A report is an analysis based on a largely visual examination. Read the contract carefully.
 
<b>Who works for whom?</b> Buyers should be wary of reports done for vendors and vice-versa. Inspectors should be impartial third parties, but it's an unregulated business. Some may be willing to sacrifice objectivity to help a sale. Some may have inappropriately close relationships with real-estate agents.
 
<b>The big stuff:</b> Demand a clear statement on the foundation and structural integrity and estimates of repair costs. Attic mould, signs of basement leakage, substandard wiring or insulation materials such as vermiculite, asbestos and urea formaldehyde can disqualify you from a mortgage or insurance. How long till the house needs a new roof, furnace or windows? Find out what costs to deduct from an offer.
 
<b>Seller beware:</b> Having your home inspected before listing it can head off untimely surprises. It can let you be up front with buyers or enable you to seek good contractors to get the work done at a fair price. Pre-listing inspections can also help vendors rebut dubious claims from buyers' inspectors.
 
<b>The bottom line:</b> A typical home should take two to three hours to inspect, covering 400 checks, and cost in the <b>$400 to $600</b> range. Be leery of an inspector who offers discounts or to fix problems he finds.<br> 

Only those inspectors, who charge a professional fee, do a real professional job. Everyone else is looking around.

We <b>guarantee</b> your complete satisfaction or your money back.
