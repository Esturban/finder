<br />- we also have (6) SIX CVI (Certified Ventilation Inspectors) on staff that can inspect your residential, commercial or industrial HVAC systems.
<br />- NADCA publishes the names of individuals that hold the ASCS designation, make sure your home is being cleaned by a certified and qualified individual; to find out if your technician is certified, please visit: www.nadca.com

That's why we're taking extensive precautions before we enter your home bu disinfecting trucks and tools, washing hands, wearing proper protection equipment, and disinfecting anything we touch. Most of the work we do does not require any interaction with customers - approvals and payments are contactless.

Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

Air Purification

The air in your home, for the most part, is the same air being re-circulated over and over again - contaminants included. These contaminants include mold, viruses, pet dander, pollens and household toxins to name a few. There are a variety of options for air purifiers, at all budget levels, that can help you take the next step in a healthier home. LG Home Comfort technicians can guide you through the simplest room solutions right up to whole home air purifiers with hepa filters and UV-C lights. At LG Home Comfort we are confident that we can find an air purification solution for your home.

 

Contact us today to book your air purification installation.

Water Purification

Your homes’ water is an essential part of your everyday life - everything you do in your home requires it! But did you know the quality of your water can also affect the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances? Hard water can cause internal build up of minerals in your washing machine, dishwasher and hot water heater. The level of water purification your home needs depends on the combination of your current water and what outcomes you are looking for.

We offer a full range of water treatment options: softeners, chlorine & iron filters and reverse osmosis units. Allow the LG team to test your water, free of charge, and design a water purification system that gives you the best water possible.

 

Contact us today to book your water purification installation or a complimentary water test.

Heating

Whether you require a tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace, let our professional team of technicians evaluate your needs and walk you through your heating options. A poorly designed and installed system can lead to low efficiency and increased operating costs - at LG Home Comfort we take the time to customize each installation to ensure peak performance and efficiency.

 

Contact us today to book your tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace appointment.

Cooling

When it comes to cooling, reliability and consistency is key. Every home is unique, which is why our team will take the time to assess your home, your cooling needs and come up with a solution that fits your needs and your budget.

 

Contact us today to book your AC repair, maintenance or installation appointment.

Water

Installing over 1000 water heaters per month, we are experts at heating your home water. Whether you need a simple repair or a new system, our technicians will walk you through the process and explain your different options. Our no-pressure sales guarantee will ensure that you can make a decision in your own time, with all of the information you need.

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA.

Not to be a killjoy, but are you inside? If so, you would probably be surprised if you knew how many toxins you may have just inhaled, including chemical vapors, microbes, mildew, viruses, bacteria, dust, dirt, pollen, allergens and more. Okay...what?

The EPA found in a survey that Americans spend 87% of their lives inside, and that indoor air pollutant levels are up to 100 times higher than pollution levels found outside. Scary! Now think about the fact that we breathe an estimated 3,000 gallons of air every single day. So do your kids. So does your Pug. Seriously, it is important that we stop taking indoor air quality for granted. Not anymore.

You really need to increase the quality of the air you breathe indoors. By taking control, you can:

    Maintain your health. That’s right. And actually, 50% of all illnesses are either caused or aggravated by polluted indoor air according to the American College of Allergists.

    Reduce your energy consumption. How? Cleaner air improves how efficient your heating and cooling system is. Can you say “smaller carbon footprint” and “lower costs over time?”
    Guard your investment. Improved air quality keeps heating and air conditioning components from corrosion, microbials, dirt and debris.

If you’re a DIYer, you can certainly take steps to bump the air quality in your home. But even the most mechanically-minded homeowners can’t do it all… and that’s where Abbey Air Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning can provide expert help. With a complete offering of indoor air quality equipment choices, knowledge and expert service—for all makes and models, 24 hours a day—you can take a deep breath in your home and know it’s the highest indoor air quality possible.",abbey-air-home-services-by-enercare,2008-03-04T16:55:15.000-05:00,NA,"Oakville, Burlington ",,Residential Heating and Air Conditioning Products.

While working for one of the big HVAC companies, Dan & Derek worked together as partners. 

Installing top quality, high efficiency furnaces, air conditioners and tankless hot water heaters.  Over several years, we heard concerns from customers telling us, that they wished there was a company out there that was honest and trustworthy. That can perform great service at an affordable price.  We got to thinking…..why not us??  As the days went by, we heard more and more of customers wanting better customer service and dependable certified technicians.

The day finally came when they decided to just do it.  Coming up with a name that people could relate to, was the first of many steps ahead for Dan & Derek.  That’s when “D.A.D. HVAC” was born.  (Dan and Derek).  The rest, as they say, is history!!

Gas and Electricity in Ontario aren't cheap; on average 50% of the gas you pay for goes straight up the chimney. Upgrading to a High Efficient Furnace often means an increase in efficiency of over 40%. A new High Efficient Furnace is an investment that will pay for itself in a matter of years, and will PAY YOU over its lifetime.

We do not use any cheap construction-grade or entry-level equipment. We specialize in providing mid and upper tier equipment, top quality materials and craftsmanship at great affordable prices. We are devoted to customer service and satisfaction.

Most homeowners with HVAC equipment older than 10 years are unaware of the energy loss and monthly waste of lost energy costs. With our services you can reduce your monthly utilities bills.
