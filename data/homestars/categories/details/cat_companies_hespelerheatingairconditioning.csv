Air Purification

The air in your home, for the most part, is the same air being re-circulated over and over again - contaminants included. These contaminants include mold, viruses, pet dander, pollens and household toxins to name a few. There are a variety of options for air purifiers, at all budget levels, that can help you take the next step in a healthier home. LG Home Comfort technicians can guide you through the simplest room solutions right up to whole home air purifiers with hepa filters and UV-C lights. At LG Home Comfort we are confident that we can find an air purification solution for your home.

 

Contact us today to book your air purification installation.

Water Purification

Your homes’ water is an essential part of your everyday life - everything you do in your home requires it! But did you know the quality of your water can also affect the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances? Hard water can cause internal build up of minerals in your washing machine, dishwasher and hot water heater. The level of water purification your home needs depends on the combination of your current water and what outcomes you are looking for.

We offer a full range of water treatment options: softeners, chlorine & iron filters and reverse osmosis units. Allow the LG team to test your water, free of charge, and design a water purification system that gives you the best water possible.

 

Contact us today to book your water purification installation or a complimentary water test.

Heating

Whether you require a tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace, let our professional team of technicians evaluate your needs and walk you through your heating options. A poorly designed and installed system can lead to low efficiency and increased operating costs - at LG Home Comfort we take the time to customize each installation to ensure peak performance and efficiency.

 

Contact us today to book your tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace appointment.

Cooling

When it comes to cooling, reliability and consistency is key. Every home is unique, which is why our team will take the time to assess your home, your cooling needs and come up with a solution that fits your needs and your budget.

 

Contact us today to book your AC repair, maintenance or installation appointment.

Water

Installing over 1000 water heaters per month, we are experts at heating your home water. Whether you need a simple repair or a new system, our technicians will walk you through the process and explain your different options. Our no-pressure sales guarantee will ensure that you can make a decision in your own time, with all of the information you need.

Ron obtained his gas license from Mohawk College in 2011 and worked for a major heating, ventilation, and air conditioning company before founding All Ontario Mechanical and striking out on his own in 2014.
 
Since then, Ron has delivered first-rate service to hundreds of satisfied customers. Through All Ontario Mechanical he provides sales and rentals of new equipment – furnaces, air conditioners, water heaters, and humidifiers – as well as maintenance and repairs.
 
By keeping All Ontario Mechanical small and agile, Ron is able to keep his overhead low while delivering superior service at an affordable price, below that charged by the larger HVAC companies.
 
Ron enjoys meeting new people and helping them get the most out of their HVAC investment. Contact him today for a free, no-obligation quotation.
 
If you want to purchase or rent a new furnace, air conditioner, or water heater; or are looking for service for the units you already have, All Ontario Mechanical can help.
 
Having your furnace professionally maintained is an investment that will extend the life of your equipment, saving you time and money in costly repairs down the road. It will also contribute to your family’s safety, reducing the likelihood of gas leaks and carbon monoxide poisoning.
 
Ask us about our affordable rent-to-own packages that will save you thousands of dollars compared to rentals from the larger HVAC and utility providers.
