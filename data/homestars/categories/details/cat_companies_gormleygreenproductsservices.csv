Whether you are a Homeowner involved in remodeling, renovating or retrofitting your home, or an Industry Professional or Contractor looking for a reputable insulation contractor for your next project, we can deliver reliable and prompt service at a competitive price, using only the highest quality Canadian-manufactured cellulose insulation on the market today. 
With the cost of living skyrocketing, saving money by saving energy has never been more important. Heating and cooling costs can account for 50-70% of a home or building’s yearly energy expense. When installed correctly, insulation is the simplest and most cost-effective means to lower this energy use. Remember, sealing and ventilating your home correctly will not only keep you warm in winter but will also cool you down in the summer months… Insulation is the perfect four season solution to saving you money.
If you are working on a “Green Building” project, or consider environmental sustainability a factor in your decision-making when selecting an insulation installer, please contact us. We choose to install Climatizer Plus™ cellulose insulation for its superior thermal and acoustical performance as well as its environmental benefits. Climatizer Plus loose-fill cellulose is certified by UL’s ECOLOGO program; indicating that this product has undergone rigorous scientific testing, auditing, or both, to prove its compliance with stringent, third party, environmental performance standards and may help you contribute to LEED credit categories.   
Call us or “Get started today” on our website and allow us to provide you the information you need to make an informed choice for your home or building insulation needs.  We offer free in-home assessments and quotes.

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA.
