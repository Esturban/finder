Continuously Circulating Dust

You might not realize how much dust accumulates inside the ducts just from your everyday life. Multiply this amount of dust by years and years inside your home and you quickly have a major dust problem. Any time air circulates through the ducts it pushes this dirt around, which irritates your system, especially if you are already prone to allergies. You cannot get relief from this dusty air until the ducts are cleaned.

An Ideal Breeding Ground for Mold

Another serious issue to be on the lookout for within your air ducts is mold. The dark, often damp interiors of your ducts create a premium breeding ground for mold. If not properly cleaned, this mold can lead to serious respiratory irritants for you, your family or your employees. Mold is especially dangerous for young children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.

Unseen Vermin and Insects

Without regular cleanings, your air ducts could be susceptible to rodents and insects that further pollute the air you breathe and lead to bigger issues with allergies. Call in the professionals today to give you an air duct cleaning that gets rid these issues and helps you breathe easy whether you're at home or at work.
Your ducts are breeding grounds for rodents, dust mites, mould and other nasal irritants that can lead to allergies and other respiratory conditions.

The truth is (for the most part) if your ducts breathe it, you breathe it.

With brand new state-of-the art equipment, Ductwise will leave the interior surfaces of your home, commercial or industrial space bright and shiny, for your the wellbeing of your family or employees.

Make Ductwise a necessary part of your home or company's maintenance plan. Your lungs will thank you for it.

The Process:
1) The process begins with the connection of a large vacuum hose (8 inch diameter) into the return section of the duct work.

2) The entire ventilation system is then sealed, covering all supply and return grills to allow for a powerful and concentrated suction.

3) High pressure air (250 psi) is then forced through each and every return vent and continues until all return main duct trunk lines are properly cleaned.

We use a wide array of air cleaning tools, such as air whips, brushes, reverse and forward air flow jesters (air snake) to loosen or break up all caked on dirt, dust and debris from the interior surfaces of all duct lines. This process is then repeated through the supply section of the ventilation system and continued until all supply vents and main duct trunk lines are properly cleaned .
