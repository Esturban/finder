While there are many staging companies on the market, none of them provides the staging quality per dollar we are looking for when we are trying to sell our own property. As such, we see an opportunity to create a better company that provides outstanding staging quality and value than what was available on the market.

R3 Home Staging specializes in providing the highest staging quality per dollar. We strongly believe this is the best way to deliver the best value to our clients.

Through a long streak of wildly successful projects and word of mouth, we are growing faster than we ever anticipated. We believe our integrity, core values and unique presentation styles play a strong part in our rapid growth.

R3 Home Staging provides differentiating designs to showcase a property’s strengths. We understand the market and consistently helps our clients achieve record breaking sale prices in many neighborhoods across GTA.

What makes R3 Home Staging different is we do not cut corners. We treat each property like our own and work diligently to ensure each of our projects meet our high bar of quality and exceptional presentation.

What is home staging?

Home staging is a combination of Interior Decorating and Marketing. The Home Staging industry prepares a private residence for sale in the real estate marketplace. The service is designed to create a positive first impression for potential buyers. Home staging is like a cosmetic makeover for a home, sometimes involving the removal of lived-in furniture, painting over walls with neutral colours and adding eye-catching aesthetics.

A professional home staging service is designed to:

Highlight finer features of each space in a home.
Create mass appeal & the most number of potential buyers.
Sell a home faster and for more money
It’s the ultimate philosophy of Whynot Home Staging & Design. When you create mass appeal for a home, you’re essentially accentuating the best qualities and essence of every room, living, storage, and recreational space. Our mission is to help clients achieve a high return on investment by showing the property’s true potential.
How can a home sell for the highest price?
Industry sources say that staging a home provides an average of 390% return on investment.
