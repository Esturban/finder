It’s a craft I learned ‘on-the-job’ working for my Father’s landscaping company. The first contract was to install cabinets for a general contractor. Word soon spread about the company's work ethic, and our service offering expanded to interior trim, framing and siding. By 2005, we needed to hire full-time employees to help him deliver our services to an ever expanding list of satisfied clients. Our reputation attracted designers and builders of higher-end homes from across Toronto, the GTA and York Region.
Evergreen Carpentry now enjoys a reputation as the go-to option for contractors, builders and homeowners when they want top quality trim and siding products and workmanship. But many things remain the same as when Aaron decided to take that first job:
