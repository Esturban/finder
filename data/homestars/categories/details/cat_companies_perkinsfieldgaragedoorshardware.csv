Recognizing the need for custom packages, we began painting each door with automotive paint to suit each customerâ€™s specific needs. When Stanley shut down its garage door division in the early 90's, Doors and Things became one of the first dealer for Garaga insulated sectional doors in the area two years prior to them opening their new plant. To this day we remain an exclusive dealer of the Garaga products. Since 1996 Doors and Things has been a certified 'Garaga Experts' installer, providing professional service and a high standard of quality in every job. Continuing the tradition of custom work we offer a complete garage door package including framing, aluminum cladding, openers and accessories.

Together with my two sons, we've been servicing the local area for over 23 years including Midland, Penetanguishene, Tiny Township, Tay Township, Severn Township, Wasaga Beach and Collingwood. We specialize in both residential and commercial garage door applications. Our residential products range from the traditional garage door looks, or the new and very popular carriage style garage doors.
