Walk-a-way***
If there are major concerns found with the inspected house that cause you to walk away from the purchase agreement I will inspect the next home you place an offer on at half price. i.e. if second home had a rate of $375 then you would only pay $185.

Proudly serving clients in the GTA and surrounding areas. 
DSM Property Services is proud to provide our clients with professional, reliable inspection services. All our inspections are conducted by a qualified and fully accredited Registered Home Inspector (RHI) and Certified Thermographer with over 25 years experience in construction and renovation. Our inspection services include:
•	Detailed Inspection of all visible structures and components of a home,
•	Infrared thermal scans* of non-visible structures and components to detect potential issues with moisture, electrical, and insulation  
•	Use of the latest Inspection Technology
•	Repair and cost estimates
•	Recommendations and Maintenance planning
•	A fully detailed and easy to read report of all findings including pictures for quick reference
•	A reference library and links to more detailed information on the components of the home
You also have the option to purchase a detailed Home History Report.
 *Infrared Thermal Scans are part of our premium package and are conducted to detect what the naked eye cannot. This process can identify potential problems in structure, electrical components, insulation, air leakage and moisture content.
An Infrared Scan can:
•	help locate potential safety issues with live electrical equipment, 
•	detect hidden heating and cooling losses, 
•	detect moisture intrusion which could cause mould, 
•	detect inadequate or non-existent insulation, 
•	detect plumbing leaks and poor construction.
•	It could save you in potential repair costs!!
Book a thermal scan inspection:
* Before a warranty inspection
* Before a Real Estate Investment
* Before a contractor begins work
* After a completed project
* As part of a routine maintenance check on your home.

Doing your homework on finding the right Home Inspector is crucial. You need to make sure you are hiring a qualified and experienced Inspector. After all, this person will be providing you with the information you need to make an informed decision about some very costly investments, whether it be the purchase or selling of a home, a new home renovation or existing repair, maintenance of your existing home or potential issues you are having.
We hope that DSM Property Services Inc. can help you with your inspection needs!
