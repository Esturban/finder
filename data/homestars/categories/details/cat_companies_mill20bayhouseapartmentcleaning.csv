COVID-19 STATEMENT

COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic. Federal, provincial and local governments and their agencies have been announcing daily recommendations and restrictions that affect the everyday lives of every Canadian.

Whereas the health authorities are still stating that the risk of contracting the virus is low to moderate in BC, the health and safety of our staff and customers is a paramount concern for us at A Glass Act Window Cleaners & Building Maintenance.

We would ask that customers postpone in booking any INTERIOR CLEANING appointments with us until such time that the major Canadian health authorities announce that it will be safer for us to be working indoors (in your homes) in a more contained proximity to our customers.  We will continue to provide our EXTERIOR CLEANING services at this time while following the very important social distancing regulations.

In addition, we are requiring our staff to self-isolate if they become ill or if someone in their household becomes ill.  We do look forward to providing you with our exterior Spring cleaning service, to get your home or business looking refreshed and clean for the season.  We know that many of you will be spending more time in your yards, gardens and patios this Spring while staying at home.  We look forward to making your building exteriors cleaner and brighter while we all stay safer and healthy at home!!

Thank you for your understanding and support.

- healthier cleaning services for your home, family, employees, and Mother Earth by using organic cleaning materials with proper International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) and that are recognized by US Environmental Protection Agency

- equal and more employment opportunities (proactive employment and employment equity) especially for the visible minorities

For us, employment means more as a way of connecting with the Vancouver Island community, finding financial independence, and a sense of purpose.

Everymaid is on a mission for the social and environmental good.

We use and we bring our own naturally-derived, green chemistry cleaning materials and HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) Vacuum cleaner. 

Most importantly, we have liability insurance (bond). But in our years of service, we have never used the bond and rest assured we will never be able to. It's because we are certain we will make things right. You can count on our team. We will not be a 5-star rated service after all if we aren’t true to our words. 

We are available for weekly, biweekly, monthly for residential, vacation rental, commercial, move in or move out cleans. We have flexible modes of payment:cash, check, E-transfer, and credit card and all transactions will have an accompanying invoice and receipts.
