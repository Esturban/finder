Since childhood, Peter has been motivated by Architecture to examine and question our built environment. His approach has most often been hands on, as can be seen in the recognition section of our website. These practical explorations of ‘learning through making’ have accumulated into an arsenal of skills and knowledge about sustainable materials and building methods. That along with integrity and care makes LATTAG an essential part of any project (new construction and/or retrofit).

We are a licensed Architect firm by the Ontario Association of Architecture with over 15 years of design and construction experience. If you are looking to build a project that is unique to you and your family and that is on budget, we can get you there.  We like to work with our clients, not over them or under. We have different service packages that are setup for each of our projects and their level of complexity.

Check out some of our tools available to help you with your project here : http://sqvis.ca/free-guide/

1. Download our latest ""Directory of Experts"" - These are the people we know, like, and trust when it comes to Residential projects in the GTA. It is everybody you'll need on one page -simple. It took me 15 years to find these people. If you'd like a copy just send an email to info@sqvis.ca and put ""Directory"" in the subject line.
2. Join me for a One-on-one if you'd like to work directly with me to develop a great space or just have questions you need answers to so you can move forward... just send an email to info@sqvis.ca and put ""One-on-One"" in the subject line... tell me a little about your plans and what you'd like to work on, and my assistant will send you a questionnaire (nothing too heavy) and schedule a time to talk.
3. Is my site right? Buying the wrong site is THE most costly strategic mistake people make when building their dream home. ""If only I'd known"" is the phrase you don't want to be saying. The right sight can add tens of thousands to the value of your home. If you'd like site feedback before building...just send an email info@sqvis.ca and mention this service. Please include your name and phone number.

Architectural Drawings

We believe in design and architecture as an investment that increases the value of your space while improving the quality of life. We find the architectural solutions that are not directly apparent to address issues relating from space planning to other technical challenges. Whether it may be a renovation or a new build, we work with our clients to develop designs that work well on the inside and outside. Our team will work with city officials on permit requirements and develop a comprehensive set of permit drawings which include plans, sections, elevations, and any relevant details.
*******************************
Interior Design

SQ VIS’s interior design team study spaces for living and working depending on each client’s needs. Whether it may be a residential home/suite or a commercial space, our team will combine an ensemble of color, materials, texture, furniture, and lighting to create a visually impacting space that is customized to each of client's needs. The interior layout is analyzed and programmed for greater efficiency and higher productivity without compromising on style or creativity. Our interior design work includes interior residential renovations, interior commercial store renovations, and offices.
*******************************
BIM Modeling

Building Information Modelling has become the leading industry tool that is changing how architects, engineers, and the construction industry operate. With our BIM services, we are able to create or transform your project to a BIM environment. Where it is a residential or commercial project, we offer architectural solutions much more advanced than the traditional 2D drawings. Our 3D models allow you to visualize every angle of your project and collect a complete data base on customized schedules according to your project.",,We will allow you to visualize and  gain great insight into how you will live in every square foot of your space.,2012,NA,ALL payment types accepted. ,Masters of Architecture,"Licensed Architect, BCIN",Ontario Association of Architects,TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,FALSE,,1938446,Square Vis Architects Inc,19,14,49,10,"Architects, Architectural Consultants, Residential Architects, Architect, structural, engineer, architects, landscape architects, architect design, design architect, architectural design, architect landscape, landscape architect, designer architect, architect designer, 3d architect, home architect, architect home, architecture firm, architect firm, construction architect, architect studio, ,",0,NA,sqvis,FALSE,0,0,52,0,FALSE,0b779b8d898c50a7e0fd5b74be7037b50a8916a0,TRUE,2015-09-12T14:30:37.000-04:00,TRUE,FALSE,2052623,92.8937637945,309,NA,NA
