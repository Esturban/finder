The PRESSURE:
Sales person won't leave even when you tell them to ""Leave""
Sales person won't leave when you tell them ""No Thanks""
Sales person won't leave when you say ""I Already Have Your Products or Service""
Sales person name drops the name of your neighbor and makes it sound like ""they signed up"" or ""they bought one"" or ""they referred me to you""
Sales person comes to the house several times and won't leave you alone
Sales person offers cheap cameras /chances to win vacations/free groceries for a year .....anything to ENTICE YOU TO SIGN THE CONTRACT
Once the system is INSTALLED you will be LIABLE for the FULL AND COMPLETE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ( typically 3 years or more)

Shop by Brand, Hunter Douglas, Shade-O-Matic, Elite, Graber, MaxXmar, SunGlow, Altex, Eclipse, and more.

WHO WE ARE - over 35 years in the window covering business

We do one thing, and we do it Really, Really Well.

Our DRAPERY SPECIALISTS and workroom can create any soft fabric treatment.  Our showrooms carry a huge selection of designer drapery fabrics for our clients to choose from.  Many of our drapery clients come to us after we have provided 'functional' window treatments in their homes or in their friends home and others have found our showroom on their own.

MAXXMAR offers some of the most innovative and well priced window treatments in the marketplace today.  We offer the full line of MaxXmar window fashions at prices our competition can't beat.

HUNTER DOUGLAS:  We have been a Hunter Douglas dealer for over 20 years.  Both of our showrooms are SHOWCASE SHOWROOMS meaning you will find every Hunter Douglas product on display with staff who can explain every Hunter Douglas option and our volume pricing ensures that it will be unlikely you will find a lower price on you Hunter Douglas Manual and PowerView shades.

SUNGLOW:  Specializing in the manufacturing of Sunscreen roller shades for residential and commercial applications, we offer SunGlow to our clients who are looking for oversized shades not available from Hunter Douglas, Elite or MaxXmar.  Their experience in Somfy motorization, linked shades, height and width makes them one of our key suppliers for commercial and condo applications.

ELITE WINDOW FASHIONS:  Since 1967 this Canadian company has been offering a wide selection of quality window coverings.  Well priced with fabrics similar to Hunter Douglases offerings, including e-motion and Somfy motorization.

MOTORIZATION  We have been selling, installing and programming motorized shades and drapery long before it became an entry level option for automating window coverings - 35 years to be exact.  Knowledge AND experience is an absolute necessity and all of our staff and technical installers are trained.  Not only will the shades be properly installed but also programmed and integrated into a variety of smart home systems.

Our sales approach is one of collaboration.  Our staff is hired for their ability and trained to spend enough time with the client to fully understand their expectations, needs and budget.  Then we can suggest options and allow the client to make the value decision for themselves.

We spend the extra time with each client to ensure they are choosing the right product that will provide solutions to their needs.  We try our best to balance privacy, light control with the right product that fits within the clients budget.

All in all I strive to make the environment and experience as stress-free as possible for my staff and clients.

Stephen Poxon

A home automation system will monitor and/or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things (“IoT”).

A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central smart home hub (sometimes called a “gateway”). The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.

You can get help when you need it - with 24/7 professional monitoring, you’ll get notifications if unexpected events occur, and our security experts are ready to send emergency services if needed.

Control Your Home with Your Voice or Smartphone

Our complete video surveillance and smart security systems include:
- Cloud based HD video recording
- Next-gen night vision cameras
- Smart image & video notifications
- Geo-fencing automation rules
- Individual user access
- 2-Way voice communication

SMART AUTOMATION

Smart Space's advanced technology understands what's happening around your property and takes action on your behalf, proactively.  Stay connected to your home or business from anywhere. Our top-rated apps make it easy to manage your smart home or monitor your business with everything connected into a single, intuitive interface.  Smart Space's Geo-Services knows when you’re coming and going. It can automatically trigger your system to send you an arming reminder, turn your outside lights on or off, or even cool your house to the perfect temperature before you get home.  

With scenes control your entire home with just one tap. Smart Space's scenes let you adjust multiple devices simultaneously.  Smart home security means smarter home automation. With real-time data from the security sensors and connected devices around your home, your Smart Space system can understand your activity patterns and take smarter actions on your behalf than standalone devices can. 

Connect your security, lights, locks, thermostats, video and more — for monitoring and seamless automation and control of:
- Lights
- Water leaks
- Smart locks
- Garage doors
- Window and door sensors
- Video security feed
- Smart thermostats and sensors
 

CLIMATE CONTROL

Connect climate control to the rest of your home, completely streamline your smart home automation. Control on the go and enjoy flexibility and effortless peace of mind that your home climate is optimized for your schedule.  Smart climate control saves you money every month. Smart Space connects your thermostats and lighting to your security system for a smarter, more responsive set of options for saving energy. 

Manage your lights and temperature settings with automated schedules. Create easy rules to have an added layer of smart automation based on system activity.  Have your thermostat automatically set back when the system is armed away, or pause if smoke or carbon monoxide is detected to limit the circulation of fumes.  Stay in control of your energy settings even when you’re away. Get a notification if the thermostat setting is adjusted, or if the temperature in your property gets too high or too low.  You can also enable a local lock-out so that others can’t adjust the thermostat.  Smart Space can use real-time local weather data to adjust your temperature settings to save energy and money if outdoor temps spike.  Adjust lights and thermostats from home or while you’re away, with complete control through your Smart Space app or any computer.
​
COMMERCIAL BUSINESS SECURITY & AUTOMATION

Protect your business with security that goes the extra mile to keep you aware and in control from ANYWHERE.  Video monitoring with Smart Space cameras engineered for your small business allows you to check in on your business with live and recorded video from anywhere.  Engineered for small and medium sized business owners, Smarter Business Security combines intelligent intrusion detection, video surveillance, access control and energy management into a single, cost-effective solution.  Connect your security, lights, locks, thermostats, video and more, for seamless automation and control.  With real-time notifications, remote control and auto-arming, you’ll know what’s happening at your business, and know it’s secure, no matter where you are. 

Don’t waste money heating or cooling your business when no one is there. A smart thermostat helps you save automatically, even if someone forgets to turn off the AC or heating when they’re closing up for the day.

From storefronts to entire office buildings, secure your business against unauthorized access with Smarter Access Control. Now you can easily track and manage access to your properties through a user-friendly website and app.

With Smart Space's DISTRIBUTED AUDIO VIDEO SOLLUTIONS offer patrons a high-tech entertainment experience, including video walls, TV displays, streaming music, DJ plug-ins, and more.  Operating your distributed audio and video system is easy with RTI's control solutions. The system enables staff to seamlessly and quickly control the displays, music and sound levels without using a mountain of remote controls or a complex interface.

Controlling the lighting, HVAC and audio/video gear in a fast paced bar or restaurant environment can be challenging. There are continuously new users with the need to control many different systems at any given time.  With RTI remote controls, one button can be programmed to set the ""evening ambiance"" of the restaurant such as dimming the lights and activating the ""dinner"" music.

Get visibility into activity trends to make smarter decisions around staffing, promotions, energy use and more.  Easy to understand reports let you quickly see activity patterns across your business and spot unexpected changes.  With specialized business insights:
- Monitor open/close trends for each location
- Identify peak periods of activity and customer traffic
-  Pinpoint activity such as unexpected entry after hours, or doors propped open that could cause energy waste or safety concerns
- Keep a historic timestamp of which users disarmed the system
- Single site and multi-site reporting
- Choose your report schedule and view data daily, weekly or monthly
