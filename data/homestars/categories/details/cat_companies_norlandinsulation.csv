Over 28 years licensed in the electrical trade, with experience in residential, commercial, industrial, microfit and net metering solar installations, backup generators, Generlink transfer switches, aluminum wiring.  A member of the ACP program for electrical contractors, we can take care of all your electrical needs.

Envirotech Insulation specializes in installing cellulose in walls, cavities, knee walls, garage ceilings, attics, and other area that might be inaccessible without having to remove plaster, or drywall.  Through infrared we can identify problem areas of air leakage, and missing or lack of insulation to help suggest the proper recommendations for increasing the energy efficiency and comfort in your home. We also offer dense packed cellulose insulation for soundproofing/noise reduction applications. We ensure intake venting is appropriate from the soffits, and exhaust fan are connected properly.
