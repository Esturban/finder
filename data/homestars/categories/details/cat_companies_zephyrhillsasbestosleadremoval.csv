No matter where you live, the risks associated with asbestos exposure are very real. If you are involved in the trades, or you work in an industrial setting, you need to be especially aware of your surrounding environment. Construction and demolition crews working in hospitals, schools, manufacturing plants, and even residential homes are potentially at risk anytime old components are being removed including insulation, carpeting, wiring, wallboard, popcorn ceilings, siding, roofing, plaster, and many others.
.
.
Limiting oneâ€™s exposure to mould at home or work is extremely important as peopleâ€™s reactions to this fungus can vary drastically. Some may suffer only a sore throat while others may experience asthma-like symptoms and shortness of breath. Window sills, fabrics, cardboard boxes, basements, and rooms with water taps are all susceptible to excess moisture build-up. Dark spots and a musty odor indicate its presence, but unfortunately mould also thrives in locations you canâ€™t easily see: above the ceiling tiles, inside cupboards and closets, and even behind the wallpaper and walls. Renew Air in Scarborough offers mould remediation for residential and commercial customers across Canada.

We have a thorough understanding of indoor environments, building structure and potential hazards that can affect your health and housing value.

Are you planning a renovation in the near future?  It is important to sample older building materials such as plaster, drywall, vinyl floor tile, vinyl sheet flooring, ceiling tiles, pipe insulation, duct insulation and vermiculite attic insulation for asbestos content prior to demolition to prevent asbestos fibers from becoming airborne and causing a health hazard.  We can help you safely begin your renovation project.

Are you experiencing allergic symptoms such as itchy, water eyes, sore throat, headaches, cough and runny nose when youâ€™re at home? You may have hidden source of mould growth, which may be affecting your health.  We can help you identify and safely remove mould growth.

Are you thinking of buying an older home, but are worried about potential environmental issues?  We can provide an environmental inspection of your home to identify potential issues that you may encounter (mould, asbestos, lead-based paints, vermiculite, UFFI).
