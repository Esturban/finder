<b>GARAGE FLOOR</b>
10 reason to finish floor with epoxy

1. Beautification-the most obvious reason,but not to be overlooked. The difference is like night and day. With thousands of possible garage flooring epoxy,flake,stained and top coat combination you can find the right look that fits your home and style.

2. PROPERTY VALUE-Another not so obvious one would be that a finished garage floor actually increases the value of your home. In fact a lot of builders these days installing garage flooring prior to placing the home on the market to fetch a prettier penny!
The Garage is the new front door!

3. CLEAN--A garage floor coated with epoxy is EXTREMELY easy to clean. Concrete is naturally porous,so dirt,oil and other chemicals enter into the tiny pores of the concrete and are impossible to get out,therefore causing it to dull and stain.Garage floor coatings act as a sealant,allowing you to simply rinse or brush away dirt,grime,and oil

4. MORE LIGHT-Garage flooring systems generally include a glossy topcoat that is impressively reflective. This can help with lightning issues even in the most dingy of garages! Many people find it's even plausible to take out some of the existing lightning to save money on electricity while still maintaining great visibility.

5. GO GREEN-Sealing your garage floor concrete is one way to do your part in saving our environment ! This eliminates oil,brake fluid ,and other nasty chemicals from leaking into the ground from your garage floor. This coupled with the fact that you could reduce lightning due to your new garage floor's reflective properties gets you 2green thumbs up !

6. KEEPS YOU ON YOUR FEET-A wet or oily concrete floor can be hazardous and quite in these litigious times,a liability !The finish of your garage flooring system performs more just the obvious function of looking cool; it's non slip, environmentally friendly non toxic floor

7. REDUCE MVE-Moisture Vapor Emission is a common problem in coastal areas and occurs when moisture  vapor rises up trough the concrete. Not only will this wreck your concrete but it can also cause your vehicles to rust.
When selecting your epoxy garage flooring system this is something especially important to consider .

8. STOP CONCRETE EROSION-Alkali when coupled with moisture can cause serious problems for your garage floor concrete .If there are existing alkaline and moisture issues ,the concrete must be properly prepped to prevent adhesion.
Failures but once your garage flooring has been properly installed ,it will help combat concrete erosion inherently caused by these phenomenon.

9. EXPRESS YOURSELF -Not only do you have your choice of base coat epoxy,flake color and level of gloss but you have a choice of concrete stain,personal design or any image or logo.Make your garage floor your own!

10. STAY ORGANIZED-Naturally a clean ,attractive garage floor is going to motivate you to keep your new extension of your living space looking good and highly functional.

WELL THERE YOU GO-10 reasons to get your garage flooring system installed.This isn't something you want to cut cost on,your garage flooring system if applied properly and good products are used can last you a lifetime.
