We offer you a quality stone coated metal roofing product manufactured by GERARD roofing technologies. This outstanding roofing material carries a limited lifetime warranty, which is not only transferable but also non-prorated. Whether your building is a residential house, apartment, commercial building, community house or a church, GERARD roofing tiles, shakes or shingles are the ultimate solution for your roofing need.
Gerard Stone Coated Steel, ‘Canyon Shake’ metal roof tile profile offers the best of all worlds for customers who want the look of wood shake with the strength and security of steel metal roofing.  Unlike wood shake, our premium stone coated steel roofing tiles will never need the costly maintenance, upkeep and replacement that natural wood shake roofs require.

***

Natural wood shake is not water proof, and needs to be maintained / treated for mold and fungus growth, and relies heavily on a vapor barrier underlayment to protect your roof deck. Our stone coated steel tiles are waterproof, and are categorized as a ""dry under-deck"" roofing system, keeping your roof deck dry year round under the most testing of conditions. With Gerard's stone coated tiles you won't need to treat for mold and fungus, and over the decades, your shake style roof will continue to look beautiful while delivering the best protection, as the day it was installed!",vassa-metal-roofing,2013-05-13T20:18:17.000-04:00,NA,"Toronto, Hamilton, Brantford, London, Kitchener, Waterloo, Guelph, Cambridge, New Hamburg, Port Colborne, Belleville, Barrie, Orillia, Muskoka, Oakville, Burlington, Mississauga, Brampton, Oshawa, Peterborough, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Greater Southern Ontario",7 Days a Week 7am to 9pm,"Steel Metal Framed Roofing, 
Owners of our stone coated steel roofing products will also enjoy insurance premium reductions thanks to the fact that our metal roof tiles will never burn or blow off as do conventional / natural wood shake tiles.
