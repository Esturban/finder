Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

The technology was developed within the Indoor Environment Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose IAQ scientists tested it. The research was funded by US Environmental protection agency, US dept. of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and California Institute of Energy and Environment.

The University of California was granted initial patents in 1996 and 1999, and Aeroseal holds an exclusive license to the technology.",aeroseal-tech-inc,2015-01-23T22:44:19.000-05:00,NA,NA,,"Aeroseal, Smart Thermostats and more..","Toronto, GTA, Vaughan, York Region, Richmond Hill, King City, Bolton, Beeton, Aurora, Markham, Uxbridge, Newmarket, Sharon, Bradford, Simcoe County, Barrie, Aliston, Muskoka, Durham Region, Ajax, Pickering, Whitby, Oshawa, Bowmanville, Peterborough, Peel Region, Caledon, Orangeville, Georgetown, Schomberg,Mississauga, Milton, Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, Waterdown, Stoney Creek, Niagara Region, Guelph , Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and more..","Aeroseal, Pearl Homes",Complete customer service to achieve maximum results.,2004,4,"Credit Cards, Cheque, Cash.",,General Contractor/ Renovator,,TRUE,TRUE,Custom,1,TRUE,FALSE,10 Year Warranty,1927753,Aeroseal Tech Inc.,206,194,43,9.98454,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Solar Panels, Solar Panels, Solar Panel, ,Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating Installation, Heating,",0,aerosealtech,FALSE,0,0,52,0,FALSE,7c5d2bf68480644b0a629f7cfd19af8238a703b4,TRUE,2022-11-22T08:01:43.000-05:00,TRUE,TRUE,2104548,99.7819412211,376,NA,NA,NA

Air Purification

The air in your home, for the most part, is the same air being re-circulated over and over again - contaminants included. These contaminants include mold, viruses, pet dander, pollens and household toxins to name a few. There are a variety of options for air purifiers, at all budget levels, that can help you take the next step in a healthier home. LG Home Comfort technicians can guide you through the simplest room solutions right up to whole home air purifiers with hepa filters and UV-C lights. At LG Home Comfort we are confident that we can find an air purification solution for your home.

 

Contact us today to book your air purification installation.

Water Purification

Your homes’ water is an essential part of your everyday life - everything you do in your home requires it! But did you know the quality of your water can also affect the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances? Hard water can cause internal build up of minerals in your washing machine, dishwasher and hot water heater. The level of water purification your home needs depends on the combination of your current water and what outcomes you are looking for.

We offer a full range of water treatment options: softeners, chlorine & iron filters and reverse osmosis units. Allow the LG team to test your water, free of charge, and design a water purification system that gives you the best water possible.

 

Contact us today to book your water purification installation or a complimentary water test.

Heating

Whether you require a tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace, let our professional team of technicians evaluate your needs and walk you through your heating options. A poorly designed and installed system can lead to low efficiency and increased operating costs - at LG Home Comfort we take the time to customize each installation to ensure peak performance and efficiency.

 

Contact us today to book your tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace appointment.

Cooling

When it comes to cooling, reliability and consistency is key. Every home is unique, which is why our team will take the time to assess your home, your cooling needs and come up with a solution that fits your needs and your budget.

 

Contact us today to book your AC repair, maintenance or installation appointment.

Water

Installing over 1000 water heaters per month, we are experts at heating your home water. Whether you need a simple repair or a new system, our technicians will walk you through the process and explain your different options. Our no-pressure sales guarantee will ensure that you can make a decision in your own time, with all of the information you need.

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA. Our professional, courteous team members will assist you with every step of the process, ensuring complete satisfaction in our services.
