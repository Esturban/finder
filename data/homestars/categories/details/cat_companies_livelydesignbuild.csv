My name s Andre and I am a multi faceted handyman. Aside from work requiring a license or legal certification (plumbing, electrical etc.) I can certainly have a look at what you have in mind and hopefully we can reach an agreement on how to move forward with your project!
I am fully capable in painting, snow shoveling, landscaping, deck and fence building, window and door installation, roofing, lawns, I can even give music lessons and detail your car or truck if you like. If something comes up that I CANNOT do, I will say so. I wont turn your project into a nightmare you have my word on that. I might be able to point you in the right direction free of charge if I can't do it myself.
All my estimates are free as well.
So, f you interested in having a project discussed and priced out, call me. A conversation can't hurt after all I am a pretty nice guy, well raised respectful and polite. 
I can be reached on my cell @
705 280 6912
messages left @(if I am un-reachable)
705 470 2622
Ask for Andre, and have a great day either way!!
Also 3% of my profits MY profits are donated to 4Champ animal rescue, a wonderful independent organization dedicated to rehoming, fostering and adopting animals who have been abused neglected and abandoned.
ALSO
Beware, there are a lot of scammers out there, people willing to take your money and un-willing to follow through with an agreement. If you are an elderly person or single person I would highly recommend having someone with experience with you (a relative, friend or neighbor) when negotiating a price for the job and making sure they follow through. It's sad to have to say so, but their are too many people out there trying to get your money especially on sites like this when ANYONE can post ANYTHING.
Have a nice day and good luck with your project(s).",local-handyperson-services,2020-03-13T12:09:57.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,2003819,Local HandyPerson Services,0,0,0,NA,"Design/Build, Contracting, Renovation, Remodeling, Restoration, Project Management, Renovation Assistance, Reno Management, architect, architects, design build, build & design, design and build, build by design, design to build. building construction, building a house, house designs, house plans, home designs, house plan, how to design a house, design house, house design, remodeling, building and design, design for building, design building, building by design, a building design, design of building, building design, design a building, building & design,  playsets, playground, wooden playset, wooden playground, play set, ,",0,2020-03-13T12:10:29.000-04:00,FALSE,0,0,0,0,FALSE,b541230b28f3d85c16235805385ebb2d46f01c89,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2220908,0,458,NA,NA
