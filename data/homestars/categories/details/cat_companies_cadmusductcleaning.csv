We handle all aspects of residential, commercial and industrial HVAC duct cleaning.  From our inception, we have always ensured that quality has been the focal point of our business, building a highly credible reputation for exceptional service throughout the industry.  All of our work is performed by highly trained experienced technicians that are put through a rigorous training program before being allowed into the field, thus ensuring nothing but professional service and results coupled with an excellent work ethic and a genuine care & concern for the customers' property.  We use state of the art equipment, combined with effective cleaning tactics to attain those optimal results.  We pride ourselves in being air system cleaning specialists and a member of the Better Business Bureau with an exceptional A+ rating. 

Award Winning Service
 
       Customer satisfaction is extremely important to our success.  this becomes evident with a high volume of customers being either repeat clients or referrals.  Our customers have shown their satisfaction year after year as we have been voted the Readers Choice Award winner twice as the best air duct cleaners in this category.  We use high powered vacuum trucks and state of the art equipment with an effective cleaning process to attain optimal results.  Our uniformed technicians are always polite, highly knowledgeable in the indoor air quality industry and are fully insured and bonded to give our customers additional peace of mind.  We promise that you will get award winning service, first time, every time.  Try us once and you too will be telling your family and friends about our exceptional air duct cleaning service and will never again look for another duct cleaning company. 

Proof of Work
 
           Your satisfaction is airtight guaranteed with our indoor air quality control program.  We provide a visual or digital camera inspection of the existing air duct conditions with the customer present and after the work has been completed to validate right before your eyes that the duct cleaning process was done to your complete satisfaction.  It is important to note that very few companies will offer their customers an inspection service so they can see what the ducts are holding before the work begins, and what they look like after the service is finished.  A huge red flag concerning the quality of work they would conduct should go up if the company you are speaking to about air duct cleaning does not provide this very important inspection service.  We do it every time, and it's free!  Seeing is believing is how we satisfy our customers, and we even offer free photos of your ducts, both before and after, so you know the job has been done right. 
    

 We Do Not Telemarket

 
 Double Diamond Air Duct Cleaning does not engage in any form of unsolicited telemarketing practices.  We never have, and we never will.  We will never use a third party to conduct telemarketing either.  If you receive any unsolicited phone offers for air duct cleaning services from anyone claiming to be affiliated with, or employed by Double Diamond Air Duct Cleaning, be forewarned - they are not who they claim to be.  Furthermore, we, along with other reputable air duct cleaning firms, are taking steps to eradicate these telemarketers, and appreciate your patience while we work to put and end to these irritating and false practices.
