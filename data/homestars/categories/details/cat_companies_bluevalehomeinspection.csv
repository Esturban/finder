Growing up in Kitchener there was always plenty of contractor jobs. After years of working in the construction field, I joined the Canadian military, where I spent the next 6 years, serving our country with pride. 
 
  After leaving the military I wanted to get into an industry where I could help people, so I decided to become a licensed insurance agent for RBC Insurance, in their property and casualty field.  Working for an insurance company is where I noticed a severe deficiency in the standard of home inspections we would receive from our clients, when trying to bind a risk on a property.  RBC Insurance was sold to Aviva Insurance later that year and I was left with a decision to make.  I could either stay in the insurance business or I could branch out on my own, and try to fill the void I noticed was in Ontario’s home inspector market.  
 
 I decided to attend the Carson Dunlop & Associates college program to assist me in building my construction and home knowledge skillset again.  I graduated with honours from Carson Dunlop & Associates and have been a practising home inspector ever since.  I feel that with my construction, insurance and college education I am an ideal home inspector, and I personally strive to deal with all of my clients with the same integrity and professionalism I was trained to have while in the military.  I deliver a consistently professional and impartial analysis of each property I view so that my clients can make the most informed decision they can.  It is always my promise to deliver service that is second to none when it comes to my inspections and I don’t stop until my clients are satisfied with the report I have presented.
​
  Many Ontarians I've spoken with are receiving less than standard inspections.  Either through deliberate misinformation or improper training; these inspectors are costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars in expensive repairs, which might have been avoided had you been properly informed.

  That is why all of our inspectors' training exceeds the industry average, all of them having a college diploma in Home Inspections and Property Inspection techniques, making them specialists in their field.  We will continue to update the training program as new and improved techniques become available.  Continuing education is a major part of this industry and we take it very seriously to ensure that we are up-to-date with our knowledge and technical skills.
 
  We promise to never stop learning, and we promise with each and every home/property inspection that we complete, we will serve our clients to the utmost of our ability; with honesty and integrity. We will provide a completely comprehensive inspection and give you the best advice for the biggest financial decision you'll ever make.

Sincerely,
