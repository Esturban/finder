We Have You Covered No Matter What Your Flooring Needs Are
Not only does Freedom Flooring provide the services of our convenient mobile flooring truck and our professional in-home inspections, but we have the flooring selection that ensures you’ll find the right product for your next renovation or upgrade.

Carpet
Selecting carpet for your space, whether it is a living room, bedroom, or other area, is a versatile and durable choice that has an array of added benefits and advantages.

Vinyl Plank
Vinyl plank is an ideal choice for houses, offices, and other spaces that experience high amounts of foot traffic. This is because it is 100% water-resistant, and provides a superior level of durability.

Laminate
Of all the flooring types, laminate is arguably the easiest to clean and maintain. Unlike hardwood, waxing isn’t required for laminate flooring. Instead, all owners need to worry about is vacuuming and the occasional mopping.

Hardwood
Aside from being available in a wide range of finishes and styles, hardwood flooring is also the most value-adding flooring type. If you not only want to enhance the visual appeal of your living space but also want to protect your real estate investment and secure the best possible return when the time comes to sell, hardwood is likely the ideal choice for you.

Tile
Freedom Flooring stocks a selection of styles, colours, and sizes of tile, making every effort to provide our customers with a comprehensive collection of options to choose from.",freedom-floors,2022-03-14T13:24:07.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,,,,1989,10,cash,red seal master journeyman,red seal,,TRUE,TRUE,,250,TRUE,FALSE,1 year same owner ,2027808,Freedom Floors Inc,6,6,228,10,"Floor Laying & Refinishing, Hardwood Floor, Wood Floor, Floor Tile, Dance Floor, Ceramic Floor Tile, Floor Refinishing, bamboo floor, cork floor, FSC wood flooring, stone floor, marble floor, slate floor, squeaky floor repair, laminate, laminate repair, wood floor, floor and wood, wood flooring, wood floors, floors in wood, hardwood flooring, hardwood floors, hardwood floors and, hardwood floor, hardwood floor wood, wood floor flooring, refinishing, floor refinishing, floor refinishing in, refinishing floor, hardwood install, floor laying, laying a floor, flood sanding, wood floor refinishing, refinishing hardwood floors, flooring laying, wood floors refinishing, wood flooring refinishing, floor co, flooring hard wood, hard wood floors, laying floors, flooring company, flooring engineered hardwood, floor company, hard wood floor, cleaning hardwood floors, installing hardwood flooring, installing hardwood floors, installing wood flooring, installing wood floors, installing hardwood floors, installing wood flooring, installing wood floors, installing hardwood floor, hardwood flooring installation, business floor, wood flooring installation, hardwood floor installation, floor companies, lay hardwood flooring, lay hardwood floor, wood floor repair, repair wood floor, repair hardwood floor, hardwood floor repair, finishing a hardwood floor, squeeky floors,,Hardwood floors, Install hardwood floors, caulking,Tile & Stone Contractors, Natural Stone Tile, Stone Floor Tile, Ceramic Tile, Floor tile, Tile installers, Stone installers, stone counter top installers, tile counter top installers, stone backsplash intallers, granite installers, marble installers, limestone installers, linoleum installers, slate contractors, slate installers,install tite ,backsplash , fire place veenerneed someone to install blacksplash , wall stone veener bath room mosaic,",0,2022-03-14T13:40:35.000-04:00,freedomfloorsinc,FALSE,0,0,215,0,FALSE,f965eb78a4b3349335af316b0c190065b180ed5f,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2275016,69.0695970724,442,NA,NA,NA
