The company specializes in structural engineering and renovations. OCEC LTD was founded to be able to help others live their lives without unwanted obstructions. It may be a wall, a duct hump or post in the basement that is in the way of your pool table or a home gym or simply in the middle of a room. Whatever the case may be it’s not IM'possible. Our innovative approach to basement post removal has been designed and approved by qualified engineers with many satisfied customers. The method does not require any welding or major beam replacements. We have also made it possible through our ingenuity to be able to sink beams into the joists to have a perfectly flat ceiling finish on both the first and/or second floors of your home.

We are an insured business from both and engineering and construction stand point.
