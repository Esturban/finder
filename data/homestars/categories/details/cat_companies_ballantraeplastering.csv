When you think of a modern interior in a home, popcorn ceilings usually don’t make the cut. In fact, popcorn ceilings usually make a home look dated and unattractive.

Instead, a smooth ceiling has the opposite effect: it can enhance the look of a home’s interior and give it a more modern finish and feel.
But what can you do if your home has popcorn ceilings? Whether you’re looking to improve the aesthetics of your home for your own purposes or are looking to give your home a boost before selling it, removing your popcorn ceilings in favor of a smooth ceiling can make a massive difference in the look of your home.

Luckily, removing popcorn ceilings and opting for a smooth ceiling instead is as easy as making the call to professionals in popcorn ceiling removal. 
 (  These are just some of the reasons why you should upgrade your ceilings)
                  
To eliminate falling white specs
To increase your resale value
Popcorn ceilings are old-fashioned
Popcorn ceilings trap allergens
Popcorn ceilings are a breeding ground for dust-mites and spiders
They bring down the height of the ceiling
Makes room appear darker as the texture absorbs shadows from light
Makes house look modern

Let The AK PLASTERING in TORONTO transform your out dated popcorn ceilings into smooth, modern masterpieces!
