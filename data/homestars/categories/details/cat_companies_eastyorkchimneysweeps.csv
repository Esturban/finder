They are therefore one of the first places on a house to deteriorate.  This deterioration usually takes many years to begin but then progresses rapidly.  Cracked or spalled bricks, damaged flue tiles or concrete caps, or a leaning structure are signs that the chimney needs immediate attention.
 
Top Hat Chimney specializes in all aspects of chimney repair and rebuilding.  Our brick masons are unsurpassed in their level of expertise, and take pride in their workmanship.   They take great care to protect the roof and ground so that all work will be completed in a clean and safe manner.
 
All of our work is guaranteed against defect in materials and workmanship.
 
We are happy to provide references from other satisfied customers in your area.
