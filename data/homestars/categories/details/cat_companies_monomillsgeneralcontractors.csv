Most landscape and renovation companies try to serve many types of customers at the same time; homeowners, shopping centers, office buildings, golf courses, and the list goes on. They are pulled in all directions trying to be everything to everyone. At Captain Handy Co, we focus on one customer, you, the homeowner. We have a singular focus on bringing you the best landscaping and interior renovation, the best customer service, and the best value for your home. When you consider that quality renovation can improve the value of your home by 10%-15%, why wouldn’t you hire the one company that focuses specifically on residential landscaping? We are Your Residential Landscape and interior renovation Company.
Easy:

Our business makes your life easier. We are committed to improving the quality of life for our customers so they can spend their time on other things. Our customers are busy and have hectic lives.

When working with GTCC, you will have access to knowledgeable professionals working cohesively to provide you with a finished product you can be proud of for years to come. We will provide honest answers and insights to any questions or querries you have throughout the process.

First, you will start with a free consultation and estimate. This is where we will go over all of your options and approximate budgets. If you're seeking help with a smaller renovation (kitchen, bathroom, basement), we will provide you a fixed price in this phase.

Should you decide to move forward with us for a custom home addition design paclage, you will then move into the design phase. This is where you will meet with our architects and designers and together come up with a uniquely custom-tailored plan for your new custom renovation or addition.

Once we have engineered drawings for your project, we will then cost the project based on these approved drawings and provide you with a fixed price to execute the work in a timely fashion.

When we have agreed on the scope of work and price the real planning for us begins. We will provide you a project schedule and approximate start and completion date. Product will be ordered and we will be on our way.

Throughout the construction phase of the project, we will be in constant contact with you. We will keep you apprised of any pertinent information regarding your project through email and set weekly meetings.

When the work is complete, we will do a final walkthrough to discuss any potential deficiencies that must be fixed (on our dollar) and hand over the keys to your new home.

The business world is extremely fast-paced because, as the saying goes, time is money. Unfortunately, because of this mindset, we have lost some of the most important aspects of human interaction. While many companies will prioritize finishing the job as quickly as possible, at Concepts 2 Completion Inc., we make time for our clients. We want our clients to know that when you deal with us, it is not business as usual. We take the time necessary not only to get the job done but also to get to know our clients and provide high-quality services that meet their unique needs. We encourage our clients to speak freely with us so that we can make sure that their expectations are met and exceeded.",concepts-2-completion,2016-09-15T11:16:00.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,Full Service Contracting,Any thing to do with your home ,All,Customer Service Life Time Warranty,2014,8,"E-transfer, cash, cheque.

We specialize in the construction and restoration of natural waterways including eroded banks and shorelines. Our goal is to restore the environment to the way it was originally created, protect infrastructure, and improve habitat in an efficient and cost effective manner while minimizing negative effects.

​

Projects include channel improvements, Storm Water Management (SWM) pond retro-fitting and creation, as well as protection of streams, wetlands, and shorelines, and the construction of soil erosion protection zones through bank stabilization. Our projects implement the latest in bio-engineering and fluvial geomorphologic designs to ensure they are completed to the highest standard and are ecologically stable. In addition to waterway restoration, we have also had the opportunity to rehabilitate and create parklands through the construction of trails, boardwalks, and pedestrian bridges.

​

Our team has extensive experience and expertise in the field, and are able to complete projects in highly sensitive and difficult to access areas.  We own a fleet of specialized equipment which has been outfitted specifically for this type of work as we continue to develop new and innovative methods. We have a team of construction professionals with years of experience in naturalized planting, waterway restoration, and impact minimization.

​

We have collaborated on projects with conservation authorities, municipalities, ministries, and private owners to ensure that shoreline protection and stream repairs are done professionally and quickly with as little environmental impact as possible.

​

Safety is a priority to us - we are continually reviewing our processes and policies while implementing new methods to ensure we are operating as safe as possible. We are COR Certified and have an active account with ISNetworld & Avetta.

We specialize in the construction and restoration of natural waterways including eroded banks and shorelines. Our goal is to restore the environment to the way it was originally created, protect infrastructure, and improve habitat in an efficient and cost effective manner while minimizing negative effects.

​

Projects include channel improvements, Storm Water Management (SWM) pond retro-fitting and creation, as well as protection of streams, wetlands, and shorelines, and the construction of soil erosion protection zones through bank stabilization. Our projects implement the latest in bio-engineering and fluvial geomorphologic designs to ensure they are completed to the highest standard and are ecologically stable. In addition to waterway restoration, we have also had the opportunity to rehabilitate and create parklands through the construction of trails, boardwalks, and pedestrian bridges.

​

Our team has extensive experience and expertise in the field, and are able to complete projects in highly sensitive and difficult to access areas.  We own a fleet of specialized equipment which has been outfitted specifically for this type of work as we continue to develop new and innovative methods. We have a team of construction professionals with years of experience in naturalized planting, waterway restoration, and impact minimization.

​

We have collaborated on projects with conservation authorities, municipalities, ministries, and private owners to ensure that shoreline protection and stream repairs are done professionally and quickly with as little environmental impact as possible.

​

Safety is a priority to us - we are continually reviewing our processes and policies while implementing new methods to ensure we are operating as safe as possible. We are COR Certified and have an active account with ISNetworld & Avetta. We are fully insured and bonded.",rm-construction-services,2022-02-22T14:22:01.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,,2026978,RM CONSTRUCTION SERVICES,0,0,3,NA,"General Contractors, Residential General Contractor, Building Contractor, Additions, Remodeling Contractor,  Renovation, Builder, building construction, renovation, remodeling, construction builders, construction company, construction companies, home repair, construction jobs, home remodeling, general contractors, contractors general, contractor general, contractors construction, construction contractors, home improvement and remodeling, kitchen remodeling, construction contractor, builders contractors, home renovation, general contracting, building contractors, building companies, home renovations, builder contractor, building contractor, remodeling contractor, commercial construction, residential construction, house contractor, concrete contractors, home contractors, general construction, construction general, contractors remodeling, remodeling contractors, remodelers, remodel contractor, remodel contractors, general contract, commercial contractors, renovations contractors, home improvement contractor, licensed contractor, license general contractor, mud room, mudroom, caulking, ,Basement Renovation, Basement renovation, Basement remodeling, Basement remodelling, renovating your basement, renovation, waterproofing, remodeling, home renovation, house renovation, water in basement, basement waterproofing,finishing basement, moistureproof, remodeling the house, caulking,",0,2022-02-22T14:23:49.000-05:00,rmconstruction,FALSE,0,0,6,0,FALSE,8d2ecaa52833ce1ca8393964144874d97fb83a66,FALSE,NA,TRUE,TRUE,2273124,-1.0,372,NA,NA
