WOOD CHIPPING
Remove and recycle tree waste.
Cutting down a tree always involves getting rid of the remaining material. Chipping reduces a large amount of yard debris without burning wood. Additionally, chipping limbs and branches is an environmentally friendly approach to removing tree waste. Debris can be hauled away or left on-site for you to use as nutrient-rich mulch that will fertilize your garden beds and soil.
