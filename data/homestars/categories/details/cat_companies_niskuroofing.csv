OUR PROCESS
.
.
____________________________

1. WE LISTEN

Once you've reached out to us through our website, email, or phone call, the first thing our team will do is listen. During this stage, we will be ensuring we have a strong understanding of what the project will require. Once we're confident we have the necessary details for your project, we will request to schedule a date that accommodates your schedule so we can complete a thorough inspection of your roof.
____________________________

2.  WE INSPECT & COMMUNICATE

On the scheduled date/time of your roof inspection, our team will arrive and briefly speak with you about the project. During this time, you can fill us in on any further details pertaining to your roof. Following the conversation, our team will complete a thorough roof inspection (15-30mins). Throughout this inspection, we will measure your roof and assess for any risks of leaks.
 
After completing the inspection, our team will provide you with our professional recommendation on whether you should replace or repair, your roof. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have, we want to ensure you understand what we’re doing, and why we’re doing it. Following this, we will provide you with a detailed cost estimate for performing the recommended work. Once you've signed and agreed to the quote, we will schedule a date that accommodates your schedule to complete the work.
____________________________

3.  WE EXECUTE

On the scheduled date, our team will arrive in the morning with our dump trailer and equipment. Please note, you may want to avoid being home during the day, while we try our best to avoid it, roofing can, unfortunately, be quite loud from the inside. 

​When completing your roof replacement or installation, we stick to our processes, take our time, and ensure you're provided with the highest quality of service and roofing system. Typical roof replacements will take one to three days depending upon the project size.
____________________________

4.  WE FOLLOW UP

After completing the roof we will come down and finish our thorough ground-up clean-up, using our large magnet we will clean loose nails and ensure your yard is as clean, or cleaner, than when we arrived.  Once the work is done, we will have a final follow-up conversation with you. During this time will go over the project, show you photos, and ensure you're fully satisfied with the work performed before we leave. 

If you have any further questions about your roof after we've left, our staff is always available and happy to chat!
