Our landscape designs are unique to every property owner, and our landscaped projects are as detailed as you need.  TWG Landscaping will incorporate plants that will expand on your project and soften the hardscaping.  Landscapes should fit the property, and grow with the family.

Whatever your outdoor lighting needs, we have the experience and expertise to get it done right the first time.

WHAT WE DO:

We want to transform your outdoor living spaces in the best way possible. Some of our exquisite outdoor lighting options include:

-Accent lighting to subtly show off your property’s best features
-Architectural lighting to highlight your home’s unique beauty
-Pool lighting to keep your nightly swims safe
-Patio and deck lights to add excitement to your nighttime entertaining
-Garden lighting to accentuate your stunning landscaping
-Path lighting to guide your guests where they need to go
-Up-lighting for home facade, trees, and outdoor artwork

From a single small garden that needs just a touch of light, to a sprawling estate home that needs lighting with zone control automation, we offer it all.

Call us today for a free at-home consultation, and one of our lighting designers will make a customs lighting design for your unique property.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:

We are dedicated outdoor lighting designers and installers. We do one thing, and we do it the best. We aren't a sprinkler company or lawn care company moonlighting in outdoor lights when times are slow. We will be here to take the call when your lights need maintenance years down the road.

We manufacture our lights by hand, mostly in the United States but some right here in Toronto, so we can control the entire chain of quality from raw materials to your beautiful garden. 

Our designers, installers, and service crews are all our own staff: we do not use sub-contractors. With Outdoor Lighting Perspectives, your satisfaction is guaranteed in writing and backed by our 30 year on-site warranty.

THE TRUSTWORTHY CHOICE:

How can you find an outdoor lighting contractor you can trust to get the work done right, on time, and safely? 

We have been independently vetted by a third-party for our complete and up-to-date liability insurance and workers compensation coverage, our safety and training compliance, and our long established track record of happy customer referrals and testimonials. 

Companies claiming to do lighting come and go, but we're celebrating 20 years and our warranty is backed by our international network of 60+ locations. We'll install your lights today, but we'll also maintain them for years to come.

THE NEXT STEP:

We offer free design consultations and free quotes. Please contact us to discuss your outdoor lighting needs and how we can be of assistance.

Their hope is to convey the tranquil feeling of being in nature on your own property. Starting with a staff of only three in the landscaping and snow removal business, the company has now grown to a staff of over 30.  As a family-run company, their three children have grown up with the business and have naturally absorbed the skills. Learning through hands-on experience and through studying horticulture at Humber College, they have fallen in love with this rewarding industry and are excited to continue to grow.

OWNERSHIP AND CREDENTIALS
Hofstetter Landscaping is owned and operated by Rick and Ashleigh Hofstetter. Our “baby” was born in 1989 and is now 23 years old. (In case you’re wondering how old we are...suffices to say we are evergreens. :-)  Did we tell you we are a landscaping company?) 
From the beginning, we have always endeavoured to do the best quality work possible for our clients. We specialize in landscaping and that’s one of the reasons our “baby” has no siblings—no sister companies, no associates, no partners, no branches. Landscaping is what we do and we do it really well.

A TORONTO LANDSCAPING COMPANY WITH A DIFFERENCE
Ever since we started, and even more so now, we find the market exploding with Toronto landscaping companies that make a big noise about “cheap, cheap”. Now, if they were selling birds, it would be okay, but they are not, right? And yet, we often lose a job to a cheap company that “specializes” in being a “Jack-of-all-trades”. Do we want to compete with them? No. But does that mean we are frightfully expensive? Not at all! In fact, our goal is always to ensure that our customers get the best value for money and a landscape that makes them the envy of the neighbourhood without breaking the bank.

As we come across customers who do their due diligence by comparing quotes, we are very mindful and respectful of the fact that one needs to be price conscious. It’s when we are told about a competitive quote that implies “the other guy” can get the job done for less than it costs us to buy quality materials, the alarm bells go off. He needs a hefty deposit from you to pay his guys for the last job done, and of course, there is always that famous curbside taillight guarantee!

We would like to go on and tell you what we have learned and found out in these past 23 years but you wouldn't be able to read it all...

WHY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE TO ENGAGE OUR LANDSCAPING SERVICES IN TORONTO 

All we want to say is this—we do top quality work with a guarantee you can count on, every single time. If it’s not to your liking we'll do what it takes to make it right. We'll be there in years to come, particularly if the weather has given the work a beating. 

•	We are fully covered with 5 million liability insurance and WSIB approved. 
•	Our crew is safety certified or they don't work for us. 
•	Our business has City of Toronto licensing.
•	Each team member has government ID.
•	We pay our taxes and are an ethical, honest, law-abiding enterprise.

Yes, you will find cheaper Toronto landscaping companies out there. Will you find one better than us in terms of reputation for quality work and customer references? Not likely. 

Please visit our website (www.HofstetterLandscaping.com) or call us today at 647-955-8382 to book a free, no obligation landscaping consultation in Toronto.

I believe anything is possible.  Our team/crew is constantly researching new building trends and design techniques so we can share them with you. I built this company based on affordable pricing and extreme attention to detail.  I love educating  clients as questions come up, regarding our process during your installation.  I understand, through my 10 years of experience, that changes come up and I work with you on  getting your finished product exactly how you want it.  I offer free estimates and typically meet a few additional times before, depending on the project size.  My crew and I are very meticulous when it comes to detail, spacing, cutting, and finishing.  We also value going the extra mile when it comes to ensuring long lasting products-  depth of excavation/posts for our outdoor projects,   proper waterproofing techniques for our bathrooms,  framing/electrical/plumbing to code,  permits when needed, for our kitchens and basements, ect.  I have been told by previous clients that my crew and I are very professional, clean and polite.  Our passion and love for what we do is demonstrated everyday on our project sites.
