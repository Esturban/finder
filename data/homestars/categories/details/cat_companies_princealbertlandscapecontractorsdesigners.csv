Our landscape designs are unique to every property owner, and our landscaped projects are as detailed as you need.  TWG Landscaping will incorporate plants that will expand on your project and soften the hardscaping.  Landscapes should fit the property, and grow with the family.

Whatever your outdoor lighting needs, we have the experience and expertise to get it done right the first time.

WHAT WE DO:

We want to transform your outdoor living spaces in the best way possible. Some of our exquisite outdoor lighting options include:

-Accent lighting to subtly show off your property’s best features
-Architectural lighting to highlight your home’s unique beauty
-Pool lighting to keep your nightly swims safe
-Patio and deck lights to add excitement to your nighttime entertaining
-Garden lighting to accentuate your stunning landscaping
-Path lighting to guide your guests where they need to go
-Up-lighting for home facade, trees, and outdoor artwork

From a single small garden that needs just a touch of light, to a sprawling estate home that needs lighting with zone control automation, we offer it all.

Call us today for a free at-home consultation, and one of our lighting designers will make a customs lighting design for your unique property.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:

We are dedicated outdoor lighting designers and installers. We do one thing, and we do it the best. We aren't a sprinkler company or lawn care company moonlighting in outdoor lights when times are slow. We will be here to take the call when your lights need maintenance years down the road.

We manufacture our lights by hand, mostly in the United States but some right here in Toronto, so we can control the entire chain of quality from raw materials to your beautiful garden. 

Our designers, installers, and service crews are all our own staff: we do not use sub-contractors. With Outdoor Lighting Perspectives, your satisfaction is guaranteed in writing and backed by our 30 year on-site warranty.

THE TRUSTWORTHY CHOICE:

How can you find an outdoor lighting contractor you can trust to get the work done right, on time, and safely? 

We have been independently vetted by a third-party for our complete and up-to-date liability insurance and workers compensation coverage, our safety and training compliance, and our long established track record of happy customer referrals and testimonials. 

Companies claiming to do lighting come and go, but we're celebrating 20 years and our warranty is backed by our international network of 60+ locations. We'll install your lights today, but we'll also maintain them for years to come.

THE NEXT STEP:

We offer free design consultations and free quotes. Please contact us to discuss your outdoor lighting needs and how we can be of assistance.

Home-Owners and Handy Folks, I can do your Excavation, Grading, and Hardscaping work for you quickly and for about the same $$$ as you will pay for the rental of similar equipment.  My experience and expertise allows me to get more work completed, and in less time, than if you did it yourself.   Renting equipment is fairly straight forward.  However, knowing how to use that equipment safely, effectively, and efficiently, are skills that take a long time to perfect.  What I can do in hours, most people would take several days to complete.


Expert Services include; 


Landscaping - Grading and Leveling (Laser guided accuracy) 
Driveways - Removals, Prep. and/or Widening. 
Excavation - for Additions, Repairs. Basement Walkouts/ups. 
Patio or Garage - Pad preps or footing digs and installations. 
Waterproofing excavating. 
Back filling
Above or On Ground pools - preps. or fill-ins
Trenching -Water, Sewer, Hydro, Drainage or?? 
Ditching - cleaning, modification, or creation.
