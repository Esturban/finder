Do you need a Full Home Renovation, New Construction, Extension, Addition, Second Floor, Basement or Kitchen Renovation?

We begin with a Free Consultation in your Home. We want to learn about your current layout, design and structural features. We also want to know what you do and don't like about your home. Next our Designer will do an extensive brainstorming of possible designs, colour tones and layouts. She will put together a proposal and recommend what styles go well with your home and preferences. The planning and design is the most important part of a home renovation. 

Next we have a Contractor with over 40 years of construction experience in Toronto. He will look at all the structural changes, interior and exterior finishes etc. to calculate your construction cost. We work with you and make adjustments until you are satisfied with the scope of your renovation and budget. Everything is on paper, we do not touch your home until you give us your approval. 

We then put together a rigid timeline and schedule. Materials are sourced and contractors begin their work. To keep your money safe, we want to minimize up front deposits and pay progress payments only after each stage is completed. Our goal is to keep you informed throughout the entire process, whilst allowing you to focus on your daily work, family and social life.

now in our 16th year in business we have been fortunate to work with extraordinary clients in both commercial and residential design. Our experience in both commercial and residential design has provided our design savvy clientele with unique and timeless design solutions. We pride ourselves on our personalized approach to our work and often build a personal relationship with our clients that lasts long after the project is completed.
In 2008, we also founded “Homes by Anacleto Design”, our sister company, which oversees the design, construction and project management of our residential work. Design-build is literally what we do; we purchase land, research and assess the potential of the site, design the project accordingly, build it and sell it. We offer this “One Stop Shop” experience for our clients as well who are seeking a hip, urban design which is paired successfully with old world craftsmanship. With three new complete house projects booked thus far for “2014”, it is proving to be another exciting year of growth and success for both companies.
