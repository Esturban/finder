We are a C-NRPP certified, full service radon and building science company, for both commercial and residential projects.  
We also mitigate radon levels in existing buildings, install new construction details, and provide radon related certification and continuing education training.  
Our services also include testing, design, analysis, inspections, research and development as well as consultation.  
We develop and maintain NORM management programs to meet Occupational Health and Safety requirements. 

Our technical expertise in the understanding of building science and system design ensures that the final installation is the best fit for the many factors that influence radon infiltration such as construction type, climate, geology, and the operating systems of a building.  
We specialize in technical diagnostics and challenging projects.  

We are a recognized industry leader in the radon services industry and are known nationally for our high-quality work and for our science-based design of effective and efficient radon control systems specific to Canada’s cold climate.

Our history:
Two of our founders built their own home in 2006.  They had heard about radon but were assured by almost everyone they talked to that it was not a problem in Alberta.  A couple of years later they decided to test anyway and were surprised with the findings.  They had radon in their home above the acceptable levels.  They reduced their levels and then started to test the homes of family and friends.  42% of them had levels higher than the acceptable guidelines.  One founder’s levels were so high that based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines her family should have evacuated their home within 3 months.  They had been living in the home for 8 years with their young children.  Hence, in 2012 Radon West Ltd. was born in 2012.  Now our team of 7 operates out of a head office in Okotoks, Alberta as well as field locations in Cochrane and Calgary.  

Areas of expertise: 
Our understanding of the science behind radon entry and mitigation has created our reputation as a “different kind” of radon professional.  Our company is science driven and with that comes curiosity and exploring different ways to do things.  We are well equipped to more than just the standard radon testing and mitigation that is common in the industry. 

Mitigation:
The majority of radon reduction systems in Canada are depressurization systems for which we have a defined process that ensures we are designing systems specific to the building.  It begins with a site assessment to help define scope and develop budget for mitigation activities.  Next, we perform detailed diagnostics to determine natural pressure, design pressure and minimum target pressure for effective radon protection.  Then we develop soil resistance and pipe resistance measurements to allow for an accurate estimate of the depressurization fan characteristics required for the design.  Next, we apply temperature correction factors to ensure systems will work in the coldest time of the year. Construction of the sub-slab mitigation system according to design and budget is completed and documented in a detailed as-built application relating to the project.  The system is commissioned and a short-term test is performed to verify system effectiveness.  Some systems require different mitigation techniques, such as HVAC changes, but each building is different and the best mitigation type can only be determined once testing and diagnostics have been completed.

Radon in air testing:
We have experience managing large-scale testing projects.  In the last 2 years we have managed test distribution, quality assurance and quality control activities for more than 10,000 buildings.  We follow stringent quality control/assurance protocols.  

We also offer residential test kits for home owners.  Our kits are different than most others because we complete the same stringent quality control and assurance testing so homeowners have the same quality when testing their home themselves.

Radon in water testing:
If there are areas where the UofC processes significant quantities of groundwater, Radon West has experience quantifying the contribution of processing groundwater on the radon level.

Radon emanation from building materials (flux) testing:
In the unlikely event that radon emanation is thought to be a significant factor; we have the ability to quantify the impact of radon emanation inhouse.

Gamma radiation testing:
Certain types of radon mitigation systems can create gamma radiation issues.  We have the equipment and knowledge to measure and analyze gamma radiation.

Building Code:
Radon is our business and we recognize how and which parts of the building code are directly related to radon.  We can evaluate and understand how different technologies and products can improve or impede the ultimate goal of radon reduction.

Building Envelope Testing:
Radon entry and mitigation is all about building science.  We need to understand how the building is operating before we can remediate efficiently and effectively.  We use blower doors, duct blasters, thermal imaging cameras and smoke machines, etc.  We consider these building science skills invaluable however few people in the industry have them.

Research and Development:
As with any science-based company we know that increased information drives better technologies, processes and policy.  We collaborate with other specialized scientists, like sound engineers for example, to help improve and develop new techniques for both radon testing and mitigation to make systems less intrusive, more energy efficient and effective. 

Training: 
We are one of only four C-NRPP approved trainers in Canada and the only one in Western Canada that provides certification and continuing education courses in the field of radon measurement and mitigation.
