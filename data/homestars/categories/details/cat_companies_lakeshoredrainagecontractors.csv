Most people do not know what is more distressing A) Having a plumbing problem or B) Having a pushy salesman in their home selling excessive services at outrageous prices. Advanced plumbing operates differently. Our family run business with two generations of plumbers take pride …

No more unattended drainage problem resulting in slow running drains especially in the kitchen, laundry and bathrooms. Snaking is often successful but hydro jetting could be the answer to remove oil and grease settled in the drain.

Let Advanced Plumbing analyze and diagnose your drain buildup, blockages, or cracks in the pipes which can lead to overflowing sinks and backed-up toilets. Prevent a catastrophic sewer flood by installing an inexpensive backwater valve.

All houses in Toronto built prior to 1985 have vitrified clay underground drain pipes. In some areas, houses have two drain systems - sanitary and storm - while most have only the one sanitary system.

All plumbing fixtures in a house that transport waste – human and other - are connected to the sanitary sewage system. Sanitary sewage should be properly treated at treatment plants since it contains numerous impurities and bacteria. The standard size of the sanitary sewage pipe is 4 inches and in most cases this pipe is installed under concrete floor in the basement. Within a house, these sanitary sewage pipes are considered drain pipes, while those outside the house (but still connected) are classified as sewer pipes.

From 1985, plumbers began to use specially designed plastic PVC pipes. Clay pipes were once a viable option, but now the City of Toronto has many houses over 80 years old that feature an old and outdated clay sewage system - these clay pipes have naturally suffered deterioration and destruction due to old age, and this fact compromises their integrity and effectiveness. When old clay pipes break, which is common, soil enters and/or heavy pieces fall into the line, promoting the collection of debris, all of which slows down drainage and eventually creates blockages and backups. Also, tree roots easily find their way into these cracks and breakages, speeding up the deterioration process of these clay pipes and making the breaks even larger. Another natural disadvantage of a clay drain/sewer line is the large number of joints as compared to PVC; these many connections compromise the strength of the pipe and naturally invite those tree roots to break them up. Plastic PVC pipes are infinitely more effective and reliable because they feature longer unified lengths and have fewer, more secure joints.

Also, many houses in Toronto still have building traps, which are a U-bend clay pipe that was installed outside the house and its purpose was to prevent sewer gases from coming into the house. According to the new plumbing codes, every plumbing fixture in the house must have own trap, like the one you can see under the kitchen sink ; furthermore, double trapping is prohibited. Consequently, those 4'' clay traps are now useless. Moreover, old building traps cause 9 out of 10 sewer backups in Toronto. If you are homeowner and would like to find out whether your house has a building trap, just check your front yard for a cast iron mushroom cap on a pipe close to the surface – this is the vent that is installed upstream from the building trap.
It is very important to check all the underground drain pipes that are part of your house’s sanitary sewage system with a camera and/or a scope.

Mister Plumber offers full underground drain camera inspection, with DVD recording option available. If your house has outdoor clay sewer pipes, it is highly recommended to install two clean-outs outside: one clean-out should be connected to the city line to the city and the other to your house. Very often, when there are no clean-outs and there is a major drain issue on the city side, city workers from the Toronto Sewer Department refuse to fix the problem – their excuse is that they do not have access. Call Mister Plumber and talk to our licensed plumbers about installing of drain clean-outs outside of your house. Also, in many cases, it is possible to combine installation of two clean-outs with backwater valve that helps prevent basement floods. There is a rebate program for Toronto homeowners, so eventual expense could be reduced by almost $1250. There are a few types of backwater valves that are approved by City of Toronto for rebate. Our plumbers can determine what type is best according to the drain pipe slope

Another requirement of the new plumbing codes is that every house must have a floor drain in the furnace room. You may not see sewage backup in a furnace room because all contaminated waste water comes to the weeping tiles around the house and gradually gets distributed around the house consequently, an incredibly bad smell may result in the basement
Signs that your main underground drain has some issues:

    Water buildup around the floor drain
    Bad toilet flushing in the basement
    Bubbling in a bathtub after flushing
    sewer smell in the basement
    sewage backup in shower after toilet flushing

Many people think that a simple drain snake might resolve all their problems. Snaking only helps when the pipe is not broken and blockage happens as a result of an obstruction that has fallen in.
If you are looking for a permanent solution to your drain issue, you musty inspect with a camera in order to discover the cause of the problem.

Do not hesitate to call Mister Plumber and talk about your drain concerns, especially if they constitute an emergency.

Sump pumps are an important part of almost every basement. In Toronto, every newly built house must have a sump pump. Some older houses still have a combined drain, which has the weeping tiles connected to sanitary drain. There two types of sewage: sanitary and storm. Sanitary sewage comes from plumbing fixtures such as toilets, sinks, bathtubs etc. Storm sewage comes from weeping tiles and walk-out drains. Storm sewage is considered “clear waste” and it goes to the lake without any treatment. Sanitary sewage must be treated at a plant, which implies all those requisite chemicals for purification. The load to sewer pipes increases every year and underground pipes remain the same. Hundreds of new buildings add significant amounts of sanitary waste to Toronto sewers. To reduce costs in treatment of such sewage, the City Of Toronto encourages homeowners to disconnect their weeping tiles from combined drains and install sump pumps that discharge underground water to front or back yards. There are some incentives for homeowners in Toronto, such as the Toronto Flood Protection Subsidy Program ; for disconnecting your weeping tiles and installing a new sump pump, every homeowner is eligible to get a rebate of $ 1750, together with backwater valve installation grant ($ 2800). For more details, please contact Mister Plumber at 416-939-1530.

Toronto-plumbers-Sump pump and check valve installationThere are two types of sump pumps: pedestal and submersible. In pedestal pumps, the electrical motor is located above water level and the suction pipe is submersed into the waste water. Submersible pumps have their electrical motors in a body filled with oil and located at the bottom of the sump pit ; the body of such pumps is waterproofed and that is why it can work completely under water. For residential applications pumps are from 1/3 HP to 1 HP. Many people think that if they install a very powerful pump, it will be more reliable and last longer. What really breaks sump pumps is turning in on/off frequently off. Therefore, the 1/3HP or 1/2HP varieties are a better choice. During the last heavy rainstorm in July 2013 that affected many residents in Toronto and Mississauga, a lot of homes were flooded because of power outages that caused significant damage. So if you would like to protect your basement from flood, we can offer emergency backup sump pumps that will work in case of power outages. These secondary emergency sump pumps use batteries or water pressure from the main cold water pipe. Battery backup sump pumps can be installed in any basement, while water jet sump pumps can only be installed in basements that have at least a ¾’’waterline from the street and the water pipe is located close to the sump pit. Water jet pumps use water pressure, and on average, it discharges one gallon of water for every two gallons of waste water from the sump well.",mister-plumber,2009-03-02T09:18:03.000-05:00,NA,"Toronto, North York, Mississauga, Etobicoke, East York, Scarborough, Oakville, Woodbridge ",OPEN 24/7,"Mister Plumber supplies and install "" MAINLINE"" full port backwater valve.

A good way to protect against sewage backups is to install backflow valves, which are designed to block flow into the house.
Valves vary in complexity, tightness of their seals and ease of operation.  For example, gate valves are backflow valve backwater valve generally complex and require you to be there at the time of crisis to operate them by hand, but they supply a very tight seal.  Flap or check valves, which allow flow out of the house and close automatically when flow reverses, are simpler.  Our award-winning Mainline check-valve design offers an exceptionally tight seal when compared to a gate valve and still requires periodic testing, but they protect you automatically, even if you are not at home!

Many municipal Building Codes require you to have a backwater valve if your plumbing fixtures are below the top of the first upstream manhole on your street.  A properly operating backwater valve allows flow to only go in one direction (out), preventing wastewater from entering your building during regular sewer system maintenance or accidental sewer system backups.  To find out if you have or need a backwater valve, check your plumbing plans or consult with your builder or a professional plumber.  Remember, if sewage backs up into your home, the cost to repair damages and clean up the mess will be well higher than the cost to install a valve.  Laws allow that towns and municipalities cannot be held liable for damages when a backwater valve has not been installed by a property owner.  Truly, ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!""

The following should be kept in mind when installing backflow valves:
Local codes and ordinances regarding backflow valves must be carefully checked to avoid having to tear out and replace with an approved valve.
Changes to home plumbing must be done by licensed plumbers or contractors, who will ensure that the work is done correctly and according to all applicable codes.  Costs are likely to range from a few to several hundred dollars.
Some valves incorporate the advantages of both gate and flap valves into a single design.  Plumbers and contractors can provide advice on the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various types of backflow valves.
Valves should be installed on all pipes that leave the house or that are connected to equipment that is below the potential flood level.  So valves may be needed on washing machine drain lines, laundry sinks, fuel oil lines, rain downspouts, and sump pumps, as well as sewer/septic connections.
Sump pumps are sometimes connected to underground drain lines, which may be difficult to seal off

Galvanized Pipes
Galvanized pipes are usually made of steel that is coated in zinc. This zinc coating prevents corrosion of the pipe, and this piping material can be found in residential homes although it is as not widely used as other piping materials. Galvanized pipes are prone to rusting on the inside, which can lead to brown-coloured water as the rust breaks off of the pipe.
