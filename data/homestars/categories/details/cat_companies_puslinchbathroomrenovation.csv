HOW IT WORKS:

INTRODUCTION
Get in contact and we’ll send an online form that helps us understand your needs. We’ll also ask for any existing photos, plans, Houzz Idea books, and Pinterest board links. The more info you provide, the better!

PREPARATION
If you like, we’ll research ideas beforehand to review at the consult. Otherwise, we’ll develop ideas together with you “on the spot” when we meet.

THE CONSULT
Together with you (on a video conference or in our studio), we’ll review concepts and solutions to solve your design dilemmas. Whether your project is construction or decor related, the consultation is tailored to suit your needs.

FOLLOW UP
After the session, we’ll follow up with an email so you know where and how to get everything. If you need additional research afterwards, that can be available as well.",niloozzdesign,2021-12-09T23:18:19.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,"1- E-DESIGN

There is no project to small and no renovation project to large for us to handle.  
-We work with a variety of agents who have clients moving into their new 2 story properties or condos which have very tight time lines.  We have accomplished full 3 story (including basement) renovations in 5 weeks flats when necessary.  
-We have many recurring clients which use our services for each challenge they face.  If you aren't ready to do a full project in a single swing,  we can help you break down the project into proper stepping stones to spend where necessary and when necessary. 


We are a phone call or email away and would be honored to work with you. ",cmy-renovations-ltd,2021-12-29T10:52:04.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,Custom Wall Graphics ,"Design
