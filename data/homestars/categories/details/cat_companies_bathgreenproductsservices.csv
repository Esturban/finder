Whether you are a Homeowner involved in remodeling, renovating or retrofitting your home, or an Industry Professional or Contractor looking for a reputable insulation contractor for your next project, we can deliver reliable and prompt service at a competitive price, using only the highest quality Canadian-manufactured cellulose insulation on the market today. 
With the cost of living skyrocketing, saving money by saving energy has never been more important. Heating and cooling costs can account for 50-70% of a home or building’s yearly energy expense. When installed correctly, insulation is the simplest and most cost-effective means to lower this energy use. Remember, sealing and ventilating your home correctly will not only keep you warm in winter but will also cool you down in the summer months… Insulation is the perfect four season solution to saving you money.
If you are working on a “Green Building” project, or consider environmental sustainability a factor in your decision-making when selecting an insulation installer, please contact us. We choose to install Climatizer Plus™ cellulose insulation for its superior thermal and acoustical performance as well as its environmental benefits. Climatizer Plus loose-fill cellulose is certified by UL’s ECOLOGO program; indicating that this product has undergone rigorous scientific testing, auditing, or both, to prove its compliance with stringent, third party, environmental performance standards and may help you contribute to LEED credit categories.   
Call us or “Get started today” on our website and allow us to provide you the information you need to make an informed choice for your home or building insulation needs.  We offer free in-home assessments and quotes.

CLEAResult is the largest provider of energy efficiency services in North America. We help utilities and governments run energy conservation programs that help business and homeowners save on their bills and increase their building or home's comfort, all while reducing their impact on the environment. Our mission is to change the way people use energy.

- What We Do -

Our energy advisors provide home audits that give you a chance to understand your home in a new light. During the audit, we'll walk through your home, taking pictures and notes of its dimensions, construction materials, and mechanical systems. We'll also perform a blower door test to determine how much air your home leaks. We use this information to breakdown your home's energy use, give it an official energy rating and give you a report on which energy efficient upgrades you should consider for your home.

Our advisors are also able to help you use your audit to apply for up to $5,600 in rebates on qualifying energy-efficient upgrades through Canada's Greener Homes Program and Enbridge's Home Retrofit Program, as well as local and federal zero-interest home loans for energy efficient upgrades (Greener Homes Durham, Toronto Home Energy Loan Program, Better Homes Kingston, Better Homes Ottawa)
