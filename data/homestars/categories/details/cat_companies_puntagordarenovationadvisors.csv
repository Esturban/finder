That's because successful renovations aren't as easy as they seem. Far from it. Behind what looks like a simple process lurks the potential for very expensive, very frustrating lessons. In fact, it's more than just potential. The frequency of catastrophic cost over-runs, shoddy workmanship, pro-longed timelines and dishonesty in the trades is high and rising. And even if your contractor is completely trustworthy there's still the reality that his errors, however honest, still cost you in the end.

Why assume this kind of risk, when a renovation coach can eliminate it?
