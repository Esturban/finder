Things to look for that can be contributing to your wet basement:

-	Are your down spouts discharging at the side of your house or are they connected to the ground?
-	Is the grade sloping towards your house causing a wet basement? 
-	Do you see any signs of a foundation concrete crack? 
-	How old is your home is and what condition are your weeping tiles are in?

<br />Tired of mopping the water in your basement? Does your basement smell of mould and mildew? Is your foundation wall retaining water slowly and deteriorating? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, then the following will describe the reasons why, and how, to eliminate the problem. The cause of your basement's musty smell is because your foundation wall is retaining water, be it in the hollow block cavities or trapped behind the double brick or stone wall, as well as the water that is absorbed by the block, brick and stone. This combination causes the wall to produce mould, mildew and epharecense. The water trapped in the wall slowly deteriorates the wall, starting at the bottom.The water that makes its way into the basement through the wall and seems to cause us the most grief may not be the most concerning problem. The same problem will not occur with a solid poured concrete wall. The reason being you will find a defined crack in the solid wall that allows all the water to enter in, without retaining little, or any water.Regardless of which type of foundation you have, it can become watertight, mould and mildew-free by sealing your foundation from the OUTSIDE. With solid poured concrete foundations, you can inject the crack from the inside and the elements stay out.You must expose your foundation wall from grade level to 6"" below the top of the footing. Then you must clean the wall thoroughly, exposing the deteriorated areas and cleaning all the dust and dirt from the wall. Then, restore any cracks or loose mortar joints with hydrolic cement. Cement coat the wall,Tar and install 6mm poly plastic on top. Once the wall is treated, install a 4"" continuous weeping tile covered with 6 inches of 3/4"" stone. Then back-fill the earth compacting at every foot. At grade level slope the earth, concrete, interlocking etc. away from the house.This method never fails. I have used this system over 13 years without fail. I have the references for you to refer to. We also have a photo album to take you step by step through the procedure.So, stop mopping! Relieve your allergies from mold and mildew and restore your foundation. When you do decide to restore your foundation do it the right way - from the outside. Remember, 40% of all my work is fixing other people's attempt to stop the water.",mud-monkeys-waterproofing,2007-09-10T16:08:20.000-04:00,NA,"For interior and exterior waterproofing, as well as benching and underpinning we will work south of 401 to the lake from Victoria Park to Kipling.",24 hrs (365 days),,"Interior/Exterior Waterproofing, Benching, Underpinning, Concrete Floors",,,1996,25,"We now accept debit and credit (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), as well as cheques",We will gladly send our customers a copy of our liability insurance at their request,Yes,,TRUE,FALSE,,We will gladly send our customers a copy of our WSIB clearance certificate at their request,TRUE,FALSE,All waterproofing work completed by Mud Monkey's Inc. carries a 20 year transferable warranty,104643,Mud Monkeys Waterproofing,331,306,103,9.9183,"Waterproofing, Basement Waterproofing, Foundation Waterproofing, Waterproofing Contractor, Water, Waterproof, Wet Basement, Leaky Basement, Flood, Flooded Basement, Flooding ,Waterproofing, Basement leaks, underpinning, caulking,,",3,2008-09-10T14:55:25.000-04:00,mudmonkeys,FALSE,0,0,82,100,FALSE,cc8d0b2333a0562ab0f243dfe1ec1a812e78ec22,TRUE,2022-05-25T10:02:24.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,1827980,98.4286089516,448,NA,NA

Most people do not know what is more distressing A) Having a plumbing problem or B) Having a pushy salesman in their home selling excessive services at outrageous prices. Advanced plumbing operates differently. Our family run business with two generations of plumbers take pride …

No more unattended drainage problem resulting in slow running drains especially in the kitchen, laundry and bathrooms. Snaking is often successful but hydro jetting could be the answer to remove oil and grease settled in the drain.

Let Advanced Plumbing analyze and diagnose your drain buildup, blockages, or cracks in the pipes which can lead to overflowing sinks and backed-up toilets. Prevent a catastrophic sewer flood by installing an inexpensive backwater valve.

Let us stop your toilet from constantly running or from the tank filling up on its own. We can service or if required replace your toilet.

Whether you are renovating your house or splurging on a new shower, take advantage of our bathtub and shower installation services.

Waterproofing

We have all heard the horror stories. It’s spring. The snow is melting, the rain is heavy and the basement floods.  The reasons for a wet, or even damp, basement, can be many.  Heavier rainy seasons and milder winters are causing the ground to freeze and thaw several times before spring. This contributes to constant shifts in the ground and wrecks havoc on cracked or weak foundations. As torrential rain downpours become more commonplace, these compromised foundations simply cannot keep the water out.    more about wet basements  ....

Regardless of the reason for a home’s wet basement, Aquashield Waterproofing will assess each issue and identify the most suitable solution to fix the problem(s).  more about Aquashield’s specific waterproofing techniques ...

Foundation Repair

There are many different ways to repair foundations depending on the type of foundation, the source of the problem and the level of damage.  In many cases, the foundation wall can be repaired with relatively simple and straight-forward techniques.  Depending upon the specifics of the issue and the accessibility of the problem area, repairs can be completed from either the outside or the inside of the residence.

In extreme cases, homeowners may need to consult with a structural engineer to confirm whether a home’s foundation is sound or if the foundation may need to be rebuilt.  In other cases, another foundation wall built next to the original will provide the necessary reinforcement.

Each waterproofing and foundation repair company will have its own preferred methods.  Typically, however, the solution is simple. Some companies, however, will sell homeowners on extremely expensive methods, technology and materials.  At Aquashield Waterproofing we will not complicate things unnecessarily. We will work hard to identify the most effective and cost-efficient solution for your home’s foundation issues.  more about foundations & their problems ...
Underpinning

When a basement requires more ceiling height or the foundation needs to be strengthened and stabilized, both can be achieved through underpinning.  This process involves carefully digging out small sections of the ground below the existing foundation wall in a 1-2-3 sequence that will add depth and stability. To ensure continued support for the structure, it is not safe to underpin an entire length of a wall in one go. The work must be done in sections. A small section, below and beside the existing foundation is excavated and temporary supports may be installed to support the main weight-bearing walls during this process.

The excavated sections are then filled with concrete to create a new foundation or series of concrete footings beneath the original.  This process of underpinning is an effective method to extend the depth and width of support offered by the  original foundation. Once the foundation wall is lowered, a new concrete floor can be poured, providing additional height in a basement.

Common sense dictates that you never want water ponding or pooling on the surface against the outside walls, but if it did, it shouldn't end up in your basement. If water or excessive dampness is entering through your basement foundation walls or at the footing level, then you have a serious foundation problem. Foundation waterproofing and restoration of your walls below grade with the installation of a new weeping tile system is really your only proper and long-term solution.

Please remember that unlike in previous generations, basements are now being used as living space rather than just storage or utility space. Basements have become an integral part of homes as they provide much needed and relatively affordable living space unlike additions, which can be cost prohibitive. Therefore, steps need to be taken in order to protect your basement environment as you would the upper floors of your home, should it have a leaky roof. Keep in mind, foundations are what support a house and are vital to its structural integrity.

Unfortunately they have long been neglected, as it was accepted that the basement was a dark, gloomy and musty place. Fortunately, with today's innovative building materials and advanced waterproofing systems, Watertite can offer homeowners a dry basement that will protect your existing finished space or allow you to safely create new living space such as a playroom, office or recreation room without the fear that your new finishes will be water damaged and potentially ruined by mould. Waterproofing your home will give you piece of mind knowing that you have a dry, healthy, livable basement area and at the same time you have extended the longevity and integrity of your foundation walls for many years to come.
 
Call Watertite for a free consultation before you decide to finish your basement area or if you are experiencing any of the symptoms as outlined in our Do I have a problem section, within your existing finished basement.

Quality. Integrity. Value.
 

The Inside Guys are a full-service basement improvement company, with an emphasis on basement lowering, waterproofing and underpinning. Having worked in the industry for the past 26 years, on over 250 projects within the GTA for various construction companies, we noticed that there was something missing with some of these bigger companies: the communication and professionalism was lacking on many jobsites.

We decided to model our company based on higher ethical standards combined with superior craftsmanship. We realize that we are only as good as our last job and future work success is dependent on our reputation. We not only want to exceed your expectations for the work but also how smooth the project runs so we pride ourselves on being there from the day one until it’s done.
We care about what we build for you.


WE DO ALL THE WORK.



We work with every client, one-on-one from start to finish. We promise to not only quote the work, but to also do the work.

This is something unique in our industry – we want to bring back accountability to the jobsite and ensure homeowners are treated with knowledge and respect.

From the moment we take on your project, your peace of mind is our main priority. We want a clear and transparent process, with on-going communication and continuous support so you can be assured the job will get done right the first time.


We will not only promise to do all of the day to day work but we will also act as project supervisors and ensure that each project is constructed to plan with no variations. We will deal with the City of Toronto Inspectors directly so that no communication is lost if there are ever any discrepancies.
If you have any questions at the end of the day we will provide you with pictures of the day’s work and let you know what the next steps will be.


At the end of the day, it comes down to trust. We feel that we must earn it.

At the end of each job you will receive a folder that includes the original drawings, locates, inspection reports and a zip drive of images for your peace of mind.
