Russ Bow, owner of Bow Home Comfort Systems, has been taking care of any customer that comes his way since day one. He puts pride into his work, where he can truly show his customers how much he appreciates their business. Russ’ son, Andrew, also works for Bow Home Comfort Systems.

Russ has his gas and air conditioning tickets. Andrew holds his gas ticket. Bow Home Comfort is fully insured, and can also offer Ontario Power Authority rebates on applicable purchases.

Russ and Andrew always tell their customers to be wary of those who condemn your home comfort system. They know a fix is usually at hand, and they are happy to help their customers get a few more years out of their appliances before replacing. They know you have a budget and do what they can to suit it. Additionally, they put their efforts into the little things that separate decent work from fantastic work, like:

Using drop cloths to prevent a mess
Performing their work neatly
Respecting their customers’ homes
Putting customer satisfaction above all else
