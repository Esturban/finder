We take your home and make it everything you want it to be!

Our step-by-step renovation planning will guide you through the entire process, from our initial design, all the way through to completion. You will provide us final sign-off on your Floor Plan, Selection List, Payment Summary and Renovation Contract before we begin. We encourage your input, ideas and guidance every step of the way!

We specialize in all things residential.  Whatever you're looking for: basement, kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, tiling, framing, drywall, flooring; top to bottom, we will have your home looking it's absolute best!

With three equal managing partners, you have three primary contacts for your renovation. You can speak with any of us, at anytime, 7 days a week. If one of us is with another client, simply call or email one of our other partners and we will get back to you asap.

Darryl, our Chief Contractor and Design Operator, offers over a decade of contracting experience.  With expertise in all things residential contracting, he will be at your home every day working and overseeing the entire process.  Darryl's motto is simple: I'm building it like I'm living in it.

Jason, our Chief Executive Officer, has been a Realtor for the last 18 years and also grew up in the industry, allowing him to offer the guidance and advice to help your home not only look its best, but also worth as much as possible.

Kate, our Chief Administrator and Design Consultant, runs the day-to-day operations of the entire company, but also provides a much needed different perspective for designs and plans.  She will be there to guide you from the beginning stages of planning, right through to the last nail being hammered.

No hidden costs, ever! The price we give you in our Renovation Proposal and Renovation Contract will not change unless you make an amendment after each is signed.

Additionally, we ask that you hold back 10% of the final cost of the entire project for 45 days after completion. We do this because we stand by our work, we know it is of the highest quality, and we want you to be 100% sure you are just as happy with our work, as we are when we finish.  That last 10% isn't due until the 46th day after your renovation is complete, so that you have time to enjoy our work and see it's quality.
