Company Founder- Shayne Finskars
Shayne started general construction by taking on residential renovations in his first home and using his lengthy carpentry and construction experience to conduct the renovations. During this time he gained recognition from family, friends and others over social media for the custom look and quality of these renovations. Many neighbours, friends and acquaintances asked him to take on the general contractor role for their renovations, provide advice or take on the project completely. He gained significant experience and furthered his education in the renovation and building science fields. As a result, he has taken on a number of general contractor projects while supplementing his knowledge through general residential construction course work and supply management research. As a result Shayne has gained a great appreciation for the general contracting process, attained significant knowledge on a variety of construction materials, and developed significant relationships with clientele. The progression/development in modern building sciences, and being able to build beautiful projects have motivated him to do outstanding work.
