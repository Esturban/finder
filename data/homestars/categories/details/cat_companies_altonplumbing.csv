Most of the work we do does not require any interaction with customers - approvals and payments are contactless.

Aviv Plumbing Inc takes the COVID-19 pandemic very seriously. In order to protect both our clients and our team, we have implemented a strategic plan regarding service calls.
Apart from the usual hand washing and cleaning that has always been a part of our procedure, we are also imposing a series of questions at the time of booking calls. These are questions outlined by the government of Canada https://www.canada.ca/home.html follow the links to COVID-19.
Our staff will clean all tools between jobs and will be wearing masks. If you have a call booked and have answered ""yes"" to any of the questions or have not been feeling well, please call and postpone your service call.
As a service company, we cannot work remotely and self isolation will be devastating to us.
