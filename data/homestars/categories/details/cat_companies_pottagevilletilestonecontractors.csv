02.	Natural
Stone Installation.
Natural stone is an ideal decoration for those who appreciate classic beauty and references to nature in interior design. What’s more, it is a very universal material that will work both in interiors – e.g. as a kitchen or living room decoration, but also outside – as a facade or fence covering.

03.	Complete Bathroom
Renovation
Bathroom finishing is a very important and at the same time the basic element of any major renovation or interior finishing. The way in which we arrange our bathroom depends basically on only one factor, namely – the size of the bathroom. If you need to connect a hydraulic or other installation – we will also take care of that for you!

I don't just install tiles or stones, I also prepare the job before installation and demolition of old materials.
Before tiling we do drypack in the bathroom and also put Derta on the floor where the plywoods are.
So besides tiling we provide drypack, Detra, waterproofing (which is important for steam showers).
