That's why we're taking extensive precautions before we enter your home bu disinfecting trucks and tools, washing hands, wearing proper protection equipment, and disinfecting anything we touch. Most of the work we do does not require any interaction with customers - approvals and payments are contactless.

COOLING
At Belyea Bros. we install and service a range of air conditioning systems including forced air (central) air conditioning, ductless split air conditioners, and our custom designed Attic Pak and SpacePak systems. Due to our background as a hot water heating specialists we are experts at planning and executing cooling solutions for houses without ductwork.

HEATING
At Belyea Bros. Limited we hold the first heating license issued in Toronto. As a result, we have the experience to claim, “there is nothing about heating we don’t know”. We are experts in hot water, radiant in-floor, snow melt systems and forced air heating. Over a number of years we have carefully selected the products that we recommend to our customers. We sell only manufacturers that have a proven track record of quality and service so that we can offer you the best support possible. All the manufacturers we work with have parts centers or distributors within the GTA meaning we have access to a local support network. We offer only reliable premium equipment.

HOT WATER TANKS 
Water heater rentals are a great solution for many homeowners who have a short-to-medium time frame in their house, own a tenanted property, are looking for a peace-of-mind solution to address their domestic hot water needs, or simply wish to have a clear idea of their monthly house budget over the long term without the worry of heater repairs.

Many consumers are confused by which company they actually rent their water heater from, thinking that because the charge appears on their gas bill that they rent from “gas-company”. In fact, most customers in Toronto rent their heaters from Centrica PLC, an international energy services company based in the United Kingdom, which operates in Canada under the brand name Direct Energy™. Although they bill on the gas bill, they are not, in any way, affiliated with your gas utility.

Belyea Bros. has a wide range of hot water tank solutions for your family’s needs. We have an excellent rental program providing a comparable rate and great reliable products. We provide a fix rate increase, unlike the other guys who may raise your billing at anytime. 

TANKLESS HOT WATER
Tankless hot water heaters are common in Europe and Japan. They can supply an endless supply of hot water, with greater energy savings than conventional tanks. They are, however, limited in the amount of hot water that can be produced at one time and the upfront costs are higher.

ELECTRICAL SERVICE
Belyea Bros. Electrical specializes in helping home and business owners in the older neighborhoods of Toronto. We provide electrical service, repair and installation whether it’s diagnosing and fixing a broken outlet, or re-wiring your whole home, Belyea Bros. Electrical is here to help.

The company is owned and operated by Grant and Greg Dainty, third generation HVAC technicians.

Our History
Grant and Greg owe their business prowess to their grandfather, Tom Rodman, who perfected his skills in the sheet metal trade while working at the General Motor's plant in Oshawa before founding his own business, Rodman Sheet Metal, in 1949, during a time when sheet metal fittings were still produced by hand. Tom and his staff are responsible for the installation of hundreds of oil furnaces and duct systems in homes that were built across Ajax, Pickering, Whitby and Oshawa during the 1950s and 60s. Rodman Sheet Metal was eventually renamed to Rodman Heating.
In 1972, Greg and Grant's father, Ron Dainty, a certified Tool & Die Maker, joined the Rodman Heating team as a sheet metal apprentice. Ron expanded his skill set to include an expertise in oil and natural gas furnaces and central air conditioning. By 1975, Tom was ready to retire his tool belt, and handed the reigns of the business over to Ron. Under Ron's leadership, the company was once again re-branded, this time to reflect their new service offerings – Rodman Heating & Air Condition
Curious as youngsters, Greg and Grant grew up immersed in the family business. During the late 70s, they worked part time as summer students alongside their father. After graduating from college, the twins both took on full-time roles in family business, taking advantage of hands on learning in every aspect of the heating and cooling business. From the sweat and toil of the sheet metal shop producing custom duct work by hand, to the installing furnaces and air conditioners, to answering the phones and going on late-night service calls, they could do it all.  
When it was Ron's turn to retire and sell the business, Grant and Greg decided to translate their hands-on experience into a successful brand of their own, and so TWINTECH was born.
With over 30 years of experience under their belts and an unparalleled reputation for delivering superior service, TWINTECH has been able to develop and maintain the long-term customer relationships that make them the envy of the industry.",twintech-heating-cooling-inc,2015-12-21T15:43:56.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Furnace

Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

The technology was developed within the Indoor Environment Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose IAQ scientists tested it. The research was funded by US Environmental protection agency, US dept. of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and California Institute of Energy and Environment.

The University of California was granted initial patents in 1996 and 1999, and Aeroseal holds an exclusive license to the technology.",aeroseal-tech-inc,2015-01-23T22:44:19.000-05:00,NA,NA,,"Aeroseal, Smart Thermostats and more..","Toronto, GTA, Vaughan, York Region, Richmond Hill, King City, Bolton, Beeton, Aurora, Markham, Uxbridge, Newmarket, Sharon, Bradford, Simcoe County, Barrie, Aliston, Muskoka, Durham Region, Ajax, Pickering, Whitby, Oshawa, Bowmanville, Peterborough, Peel Region, Caledon, Orangeville, Georgetown, Schomberg,Mississauga, Milton, Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, Waterdown, Stoney Creek, Niagara Region, Guelph , Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and more..","Aeroseal, Pearl Homes",Complete customer service to achieve maximum results.,2004,4,"Credit Cards, Cheque, Cash.",,General Contractor/ Renovator,,TRUE,TRUE,Custom,1,TRUE,FALSE,10 Year Warranty,1927753,Aeroseal Tech Inc.,205,193,43,9.98446,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Solar Panels, Solar Panels, Solar Panel, ,Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating Installation, Heating,",0,aerosealtech,FALSE,0,0,52,0,FALSE,7c5d2bf68480644b0a629f7cfd19af8238a703b4,TRUE,2021-04-01T14:01:21.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2011849,98.1110665711,376,NA,NA,NA

Hi, and welcome to Interior Climate Solutions!
My name is Nick Baker, and I am the founder of ICS. This company has grown far beyond my expectations and I couldn't be more thankful to my friends and neighbours for trusting me to service, and replace their HVAC systems to help keep the company up and running in the early days.
Now we are a small team of fully licensed technicians that have a combined 40 years experience in the trades.  We are registered with the Technical Standard Safety Authority and the Ontario Colleges Of Trades.
Our goal is to offer our customers a stress free experience in a high stress area of work. Having your furnace breakdown in the middle of winter, or your AC quit on you during our hot summer days can be a nightmare. Eliminate that stress by knowing who to call before it happens, and deal with a small company that is tailored to suit your every need. We have reduced prices compared to the big name companies, and offer a high quality product as well as a higher quality customer experience. 
In our business, the customer comes first, satisfaction is our guarantee, and we have a strong warranty to ensure that you feel confident in your choice to hire Interior Climate Solutions.

We look forward to working with you!

For new and existing homes we provide the experience, knowledge and friendly customer service to design, install, maintain and repair all types of heating systems. Specialize in hot water heating systems, we work with radiators, gas boilers, hybrid system, tankless water heaters, hydronic radiant heating systems (radiant floors) and solar heating. We also install natural gas furnaces.

At EXTEL Gas services Inc our service and knowledgeable installation technician will explain and help you choose the right air conditioning system to fit your home cooling needs.

We specialize in installing split system air conditioning systems, and ductless air conditioning systems. Call us for your home air conditioning (AC) needs and stay cool in the summer at a low cost.

We also provide HVAC Installation and Maintenance service for small commercial buildings or residential house. For new or existing buildings we can install custom sheet metal ducts that have been designed for your forced air heating and cooling needs, using quality air handlers, and natural gas furnaces that move air effectively and efficiently to maintain a consistent indoor environment for all seasons of the year.

Our company has helped those families during winter blizzards, as well as families on the other end of the spectrum, being stranded without a functioning air conditioner when it’s hot out in Toronto. In either situation, our customers just want the job to be done appropriately in an efficient manner. So, our standards aim to match those needs. We’re available every hour of the day for service calls, we have same-day service options and our technicians are prompt and reliable.

We also know that it’s not always exciting to spend your hard-earned dollars on HVAC, which is why our company works to make it affordable. With in-home cost estimates, you’ll know exactly how much you’re spending and what you’ll receive for that money. Additionally, your energy bills can go down after making sure that your HVAC Systems are as efficient as they can be.

If you have questions or comments about solutions we can provide, we urge you to give us a call at 416 849 7997 or schedule an appointment online. While you may be paying for an air conditioner, what you’re really receiving is peace of mind – and we’re happy to provide it for you.",extel-gas,2018-07-29T16:16:57.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Heating Installation & Service, AC Installation & Service, Gas Lines, Fire Places, Furnaces, Boilers, Hot Water Heaters

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA. Our professional, courteous team members will assist you with every step of the process, ensuring complete satisfaction in our services.

At Radiant Sole, we pride ourselves on our work ethic and the quality of our work. The entire rough-in stage, which consists of insulating the space with R-11 insulation and running grade-A PEX pipes, is typically completed in a single day. With Radiant Sole, you can be certain that you are getting an unparalleled level of quality at a surprisingly affordable price.

We look forward to hearing more about your project. In many cases we can suggest ideas that lead to the most efficient layout, in-turn lowering the overall cost of the system.

Give us a call or send us an email and we'll be in touch right away! Thanks for visiting our page.

More Information about Radiant Sole:

Our team has years of experience designing and installing beautiful hydronic radiant floor heating systems in the GTA. We quickly and efficiently install everything from basement systems to more complex systems including heating of the upper levels of your home. We take great pride in delivering a high quality, beautiful finished product.

Straightforward process:

We use extremely high-quality R-11 insulation and grade-A PEX pipe for the first step of the project, the rough-in. Our insulation doesn’t require messy wire mesh, leaving behind a clean, flat surface ready for the concrete slab. As soon as a heat source is installed, we return to assemble the manifold - the brain behind the system. This is what we call the hookup. You have the option of setting multiple temperature zones with separate thermostats controlling each zone.",radiant-sole-radiant-floor-heating-experts,2015-04-08T12:10:24.000-04:00,NA,NA,,,,,Snowmelting systems and hydronic heating systems,NA,NA,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,TRUE,FALSE,,1931239,Radiant Sole   Radiant Floor Heating Experts,30,27,62,10,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Floor Laying & Refinishing, Hardwood Floor, Wood Floor, Floor Tile, Dance Floor, Ceramic Floor Tile, Floor Refinishing, bamboo floor, cork floor, FSC wood flooring, stone floor, marble floor, slate floor, squeaky floor repair, laminate, laminate repair, wood floor, floor and wood, wood flooring, wood floors, floors in wood, hardwood flooring, hardwood floors, hardwood floors and, hardwood floor, hardwood floor wood, wood floor flooring, refinishing, floor refinishing, floor refinishing in, refinishing floor, hardwood install, floor laying, laying a floor, flood sanding, wood floor refinishing, refinishing hardwood floors, flooring laying, wood floors refinishing, wood flooring refinishing, floor co, flooring hard wood, hard wood floors, laying floors, flooring company, flooring engineered hardwood, floor company, hard wood floor, cleaning hardwood floors, installing hardwood flooring, installing hardwood floors, installing wood flooring, installing wood floors, installing hardwood floors, installing wood flooring, installing wood floors, installing hardwood floor, hardwood flooring installation, business floor, wood flooring installation, hardwood floor installation, floor companies, lay hardwood flooring, lay hardwood floor, wood floor repair, repair wood floor, repair hardwood floor, hardwood floor repair, finishing a hardwood floor, squeeky floors,,Hardwood floors, Install hardwood floors, caulking,",0,radiantsole,FALSE,0,0,54,0,FALSE,3bc659f856686f2f8fc2ff29bae4f3392feaf2f8,TRUE,2018-01-11T18:53:05.000-05:00,TRUE,TRUE,2025785,79.9541435736,376,NA,NA,NA

We want you to buy right from the source instead of having to go through big box retailers. By avoiding having to pay for large retail space, employee salaries and whatever other overhead, we are able to pass major savings onto you and offer furnace filters at a discount price.

We also strive in educating consumers in furnace filters installation and air quality. PureFilters strongly believes in installing furnace filters yourself, instead of paying big bucks for a technician to do it.

Before purchasing or renting an air conditioning unit, remember these helpful hints:
Measure the space that the AC unit is to fit into (height and width of the clear opening)
Know the approximate square footage of the space you wish to cool L x W = Sq. Ft.
Window units have vents on the sides, and some have top vent which cannot be obstructed
Wall units have no vents on the sides or top and fit into a “sleeve” below the window

Frequently Asked Questions
Why is it important for an air conditioner to dehumidify?
Air conditioners keep you comfortable by removing heat and moisture from the air. To do both effectively, the unit must be properly sized for your space. If the capacity is too low, you may never feel quite cool enough. When the capacity is too high, the unit produces so much cold air so quickly that the room reaches the desired temperature before the unit has adequate run time to dehumidify. The result is a cool but clammy room that can feel just as uncomfortable as one that is not cool enough.

I occasionally see black particles blowing out of my unit. What are these, & do I need to do anything about it?
If your unit is only a couple of years old, then what you are seeing is probably due to a maintenance issue. Air conditioners remove both heat and humidity from a room. That humidity condenses on the air conditioner coils and drains into the base pan where it is used to cool the unit. Occasionally, mold or mildew will take advantage of this high moisture environment. The only way to alleviate this situation is to have the unit professionally cleaned. Contact Golden Plug Air Conditioning to treat this problem.

Why is there water in the base pan of my air conditioner?
Air conditioners remove both heat and humidity from a room. This process produces condensation which runs off into the base pan. This condensation is then used to cool the hot condenser coil which improves the unit’s performance.

Are there air conditioning options for spaces without an exterior wall?
Absolutely! One of the best options is a ductless split system, because the indoor unit can be mounted virtually anywhere. Depending on the system, the indoor and outdoor units can be separated by up to 164 feet with maximum height differences of 98 feet. So even if the rooms that need cooling are located in the building’s interior or on separate floors, there may be a ductless system that will fit the application.

What model or product is best for my situation?
Depending on the type of installation and cooling capacity you need, you may find solutions that you never knew existed. To get a complete understanding of the features and benefits on available products, contact Golden Plug Air Conditioning.

What is the decibel rating of my air conditioner?
There is no industry standard for measuring the sound of room air conditioners or an independent agency to verify the ratings. We follow the guidelines set by AHAM (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers), but these guidelines do not list decibel ratings for home appliances. Without an accepted industry standard, each manufacturer can “test” for sound ratings using whatever methodology they prefer. And without a common testing method, none of the results provide accurate comparisons. That’s why we do not publish sound ratings.

What causes ice to build up in an air conditioner?
Icing can be caused by a number of factors. Units that have not been cleaned over a long period of time may have coils and fins clogged by dust, dirt or debris. Clogged coils and fins restrict air flow through the unit, which can cause the compressor to work even harder – so hard, that it may reduce the coil temperature below the normal range in an attempt to make up for the lost cooling power from the blocked coils.

Another potential cause is running a unit with a very cold set point (i.e., turning the target temperature down very low) on low fan speed for an extended period of time. This can cause excess condensate to build up on the coils, further lowering the temperature of the coil and leading to icing.

Water is draining into my room from my air conditioner. What do I do?
This problem generally has one of two causes: the unit was not installed properly with the outside lower than the inside to allow for adequate exterior drainage, or there may be a clog in the drain pan where condensate collects during operation.

If you feel that neither of these conditions exists, check for air leaking in from the outside anywhere around the unit. Air leaks will cause condensation to form on the outside of the unit, and this water will drain into your room. If there are any air leaks, resealing them should address the problem.

My unit produces cold air, but it keeps turning off & on every few minutes, & I’m never comfortable. What is happening?
Your unit is probably too large for your room and is “short cycling”. This happens when cold air from an oversized unit bounces off the wall and back towards the unit, creating a room temperature reading that’s cooler than the actual temperature. This false reading causes the compressor to shut off before the room has truly reached your desired set-point. While the compressor is off, the “real” room air enters the intake grille, and the thermostat reads that the room is no longer at the set temperature, so it turns the compressor back on. Your unit cycles off and on approximately every two to three minutes to reach the set-point. While the air coming out of the unit is cold, the compressor does not remain on long enough to cool the entire room.

The only solution is to correctly size the unit’s capacity to the room size and demand. A unit’s capacity is determined by its BTU. Larger rooms need a higher-capacity unit (a greater BTU) to cool correctly. But a unit that is too large for the room will reach its set point too quickly, and the compressor will turn off before the air conditioner has had adequate time to remove humidity from the air.

How do I choose the correct unit capacity/BTU size?
You should consider a number of variables when sizing a unit, such as location, room insulation, how many people will be using the room, size and location of windows, to name a few. Golden Plug Air Conditioning can provide you with professional advice in making this important decision.

It’s cold outside but hot inside, & I need to use my air conditioner. What now?
Your air conditioner is designed to cool in warm weather when the outside temperature is above 60° Fahrenheit and below 115° Fahrenheit, so it won’t cool a room if it’s cool outside. If you want to cool a room in the winter, set your unit to Fan Only mode (if it has one) and set the Fresh Air/Exhaust control to Fresh Air. This will bring in a supply of outside air. You can do this as long as the outside temperature is above freezing.

Can I use a cover over the outside of my air conditioner during the months when it is not in use?
Please do not cover the outside of your air conditioner unless you first remove the unit from the sleeve, clean it and dry the base pan. Air conditioners are designed to hold water in the base pan. If the air conditioner is covered, the water cannot evaporate, and mold and mildew will form. If the air conditioner is installed per the instruction, you should not have problems with air coming in or around the unit. Everything in the rear of the air conditioner is sealed, so snow and rain cannot harm the air conditioner.",1980,NA,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,,1860677,Golden Plug Air,23,17,11,8.35294,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,",0,goldenplugair,FALSE,0,0,12,NA,FALSE,ab3eb706f6a2207e99594fa934eb4e5f1b713120,TRUE,2017-01-01T09:01:17.000-05:00,TRUE,FALSE,1860873,74.1465779628,376,NA,NA,2015-09-17T12:06:41.000-04:00

We think of the 3 pillars of our foundation...

One...We are dedicated to providing homeowners with complete home energy saving solutions. When we say “COMPLETE”, WE MEAN IT! Most companies sell solely based on what they can offer. We believe that much like a doctor, every home needs to be diagnosed based on their own deficiencies.

Two...We offer a better line of products and services, all across the board! While the majority of companies offer products that insider’s call “builder grade”. Essentially a “cheaper” line of product, made to the masses. We have aligned ourselves with companies such as; York – an industry leader in HVAC, and Vinyl Guard – who offer a LIFETIME GUARANTEE on their windows and doors... Just to name a few. 

Three...We do it right! Our technicians know that our mission is to treat YOUR home better that our own. All of our installations are done by an Authorized, Licensed, Green Authority Technician. By not outsourcing the installation process, we can make sure that quality control is top notch.

In a free, one hour, in home consultation, one of our Efficiency Advisors can offer great solutions in making your home energy efficient. Our proven solutions have helped countless families save hundreds of dollars on a monthly basis.",green-authority-corp,2015-08-20T16:14:12.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,"Furnaces,
