By strategically locating devices designed to detect intrusion, Safetech's acquired a unique ability to successfully protect both people and property. By blending together different security technologies and procedures we achieve the highest security standard possible with the lowest “rate of loss” among our clients in the industry.
 
Only by taking a comprehensive integrated security approach to the needs of our clients can the best results be achieved. For instance, statistically adding an alarm will reduce a chance of a ‘break and enter’ by 10x when compared with a home that has no alarm system. However, if you combine one or more surveillance tools together, such as an alarm system combined with video surveillance cameras, your chance of a ‘break and enter’ is reduced by 40x when compared with an unprotected property.
 
Furthermore, even if you do end up being a victim of a ‘break and enter’ the amount of property stolen is 50% less than it would be if the premise only had an alarm system. Compare this to a property that has little or no protection (no alarm or video cameras) the savings are even greater, with a total 80% reduction in loss of property value. Therefore, security surveillance tools work even better when used in tandem to prevent property loss and are a very effective way of deterring and reducing crime.
 
Good Protection Starts with Good Design
 
Safetech loss prevention advisors are trained to ensure clients receive proper security coverage using the significant arsenal of security tools and techniques they have at their disposal.
 
An advisor will begin first by having a detailed discussion with our potential clients to determine their specific application and security needs. Once an advisor is satisfied that they have an understanding of the clients needs a security solution will be recommended. There is absolutely ‘no obligation’ to follow any recommendation given and there is no charge for our security evaluation.
 
Good protection may start with good design but it can only be maintained with good monitoring and management procedures.Most people think that a 24 hour monitoring station exists solely to respond to emergency signals. However, equally important is the need to respond to no signals when one is expected, or to trouble signals coming from the control panel.
 
A trouble condition may arise when a client’s alarm panel fails to send its scheduled weekly test signal to the monitoring station, or, if it sends a signal indicating that the power has failed or the back up battery is low. “How quickly a security company deciphers and responds to these conditions is a true measure of the quality of their service”.

The following is a VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
 
DISCLAIMER
BY PUBLISHING THIS PUBLIC MESSAGE  EXPECTS 
NO OBLIGATION TO BUY FROM TOTAL SECURITY CO
THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
NOT MEANT TO DISCREDIT ANY COMPANY 
 
Several alarm companies only have SUMMER PROGRAMS? They rent houses and hire large crews of university students which are offered large commissions ($400 to $500 per contract)to get you to sign up.
 
LEARN MORE by Googling ""door to door alarm scam"".
 
The PRESSURE:
Sales person won't leave even when you tell them to ""Leave""
Sales person won't leave when you tell them ""No Thanks""
Sales person won't leave when you say ""I Already Have Your Products or Service""
Sales person name drops the name of your neighbor and makes it sound like ""they signed up"" or ""they bought one"" or ""they referred me to you""
Sales person comes to the house several times and won't leave you alone
Sales person offers cheap cameras /chances to win vacations/free groceries for a year .....anything to ENTICE YOU TO SIGN THE CONTRACT
Once the system is INSTALLED you will be LIABLE for the FULL AND COMPLETE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ( typically 3 years or more)
EARLY TO TERMINATION OF CONTRACT IS LEGALLY REFERRED TO "" breach of contract"" and customer is more than likely to pay early CANCELLATION CHARGES amounting to over $700 + THE FULL VALUE OF THE CONTRACT 
Failure to. pay could result in collections , small claims and NEGATIVE REPORTING to the Credit Bureau 
 
The SOLUTIONS:
Put Up Your Hand and ""Say NO"".
Immediately close the door and the sales person will eventually leave.
Tell them ""You are Trespassing"" and that you are calling the BBB Better Business Bureau, Consumer Protection Branch and the Police if they do not leave.
BBB 1-888-352-7601, Consumer Protection (Local office)
Always Get 3 Quotes for whatever you consider purchasing. This gives you the time to gather information and to check if the ""deal"" being presented to you is the best option.
Look up reviews posted on social media such as HOMESTARS TWITTER FACEBOOK ETC.
Never Accept Quick Delivery of a product or service. This gives you a cooling off period and more time to gather facts.
If you did proceed with the offer You Have 10 Days to Change Your Mind and CANCEL (and get a full refund). It's the Law in Ontario (Consumers Protection Act)
Create Awareness and Share on Social Media as referred above.
Contact the local media

The President and founder, Tom Reimer established the business in 1986 after a personal experience of having to break into his own home after losing his keys. The point of entry was through the basement window which provided easy access. It became immediately obvious that the basement windows were very vulnerable to break and enter. Tom devised a metal window guard for his windows and, subsequently, half the neighbourhood! Hence, Metalex Security Products was born.

Protect Your Home and Family
Keep an eye on what’s happening in and around your home in real-time, no matter where you are, with Indoor and Outdoor security cameras. You can also view recorded videos as well. 

Smart locks let you lock and unlock your door right from your smartphone. So whether you are leaving the house, or just climbing into bed, you never have to wonder if you forgot to lock the door.

Answer your door even if you’re not home, with a Wi-Fi doorbell camera. You can see and speak with whoever is at the door, even if you are at work or on vacation. 

You can get help when you need it - with 24/7 professional monitoring, you’ll get notifications if unexpected events occur, and our security experts are ready to send emergency services if needed.

Control Your Home with Your Voice or Smartphone
From your smartphone, you can use Amazon Alexa (with TELUS Home Assistant) or Siri to turn on your lights, warm up or cool down your home, arm your SmartHome security system, open or close your garage door, and so much more. 



Save Money on Insurance
According to The Electronic Security Association website alarm.org,  you can save up to 20% on home insurance with a professionally installed 24/7 home monitoring system. 

You can also save up to 6% on your heating bill with smart home automation devices - like a smart thermostat. Better for your wallet and mother nature.


Flexible Installation Options
You can do it yourself - self-install your system on your own time with our online guidance. Or we can do it for you - our professional technicians will safely install your order.

We can set up an alarm system that secures your house or office everytime you leave and makes sure only the right people come in. If a certain time limit has reached without the alarm system being turned off after an entry, the monitoring station will immediatly try to contact you to make sure its not a false alarm and then proceed to call law enforcement if necessary. An ideal way to secure your property.
 
CCTV / Video Surveillance
Video surveillance systems and CCTV allow you to keep a close eye on your property – whether that be a house, apartment building, office, or factory. We offer a multitude of options, including live and recorded high-resolution streaming and viewing as well as remote live streaming that can be watched on your computer, tablet, and phone.
 
Access Control
Access control can limit who can access what areas, provide records of who entered and left the premises and when, and can offer a hierachy of clearance for specific areas. This helps protect apartment buildings, offices, and other secure or private areas. Unlike keys, which can be easily copied or lost, we can set up an access control system that makes sure that your security is not compromised.
 
Biometric Scanners
Biometrics is an extra layer of security that builds off of access control. With biometrics, you are the password. Your fingerprint will be the key to access doors, safes, and other secure areas. Biometrics also makes the entire system more trustworthy, as the identity of who accesses specific areas are instantly validated with their print. Biometrics can also be added, cancelled, and managed with the click of a button – giving you all the control you need.
 
Networking
If your business has more than one computer and employee, chances are that you could benefit from networking them. By setting up a local area network (LAN), we can connect your company’s computers and allow them to share and exchange any type of information – whether that be images, files, or documents. This can also allow the sharing of a printer as well as remote access from out of the office.
 
Medical Security and Safety
Medical issues and complications can definitely have an impact on your independence and peace of mind. With a medical security system, we can provide emergency response with a push of a button. It also provides a two-way voice system with professional operators who are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Once an operators has determined your situation, they can reach out to family, friends, neighbours, or even emergency personnel if necessary. 
 
Telephone Entry
With the use of telephone entry, usually paired with some sort of access control system in place, we can help secure a building and also offer a convenient way to provide access. Whether its an apartment building, high-rise office, or even a storefront – we can help protect your tenants and property from potential unauthorized intruders.
 
Home Automation
Technology is getting more and more integrated into our lives everyday, giving us more control than ever before. Your home – its lighting, speakers, heating and air cooling systems, and appliances – can also be controlled directly from your phone or tablet. It’s a convenient and efficient way to control your home and what goes on in it.",aca-technology,2017-08-08T15:22:30.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,"CCTV, Alarm Systems, Access Control, Home Automation, Computer Networking, Biometrics, Telephone Entry, and Medical Alert Systems","Honeywell, Digital Watchdogs, HAI, DSC, Paradox, HIKVISION, American Dynamics, BOSCH, CDVI, Cansec, Kantech, Dahua",,2006,6,"E-Transfer, Cash, Cheque, Visa & Mastercard",,,,TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Yes, ask for details.

We do not pay the monthly fee to be on Homestars, therefore I can't add my LOGO & some other features are disabled (no link to website) 
The fact that we do not pay monthly fees for this review service means we can charge our customers a bit less then our competition to get the jobs done.

We do not pay the monthly fee to be on Homestars, therefore I can't add my LOGO & some other features are disabled (no link to website) 
The fact that we do not pay monthly fees for this review service means we can charge our customers a bit less then our competition to get the jobs done.

We do not pay the monthly fee to be on Homestars, therefore I can't add my LOGO & some other features are disabled (no link to website) 
The fact that we do not pay monthly fees for this review service means we can charge our customers a bit less then our competition to get the jobs done.

We do not pay the monthly fee to be on Homestars, therefore I can't add my LOGO & some other features are disabled (no link to website) 
The fact that we do not pay monthly fees for this review service means we can charge our customers a bit less then our competition to get the jobs done.

Location & Assessment of Wildlife

    Our trained technicians will locate the animal entry point(s) and describe or show them to you.
    We will then locate the animal, determine if it is breeding, and assess the best method to get them out.

Effective Removal of Wildlife

    Our technicians will gain access to the animal and use various hands-on techniques to remove it (and babies if applicable).

Wildlife Exclusion

    We will conduct a 50-point damage inspection and advise you of any repairs that are required.
    Our wildlife technicians will seal all the potential openings in your building with heavy gauge wire screening and/or silicone caulking if required.

Why the Humane Approach is Better

Our wildlife technicians are specially trained to remove wildlife and prevent undue stress or injury to the animals. This is also a practical and economical approach. The inhumane killing, trapping or relocation of animals is illegal. Removing mothers leaves the babies to die in your building. The removal of carcasses is time consuming, costly and poses a health risk. Our focus on education and prevention makes us a leader in the wildlife control industry.

",,"Baby Raccoon Removal
Breeding season usually starts late January early February. Most raccoons will mate in March with the peak of baby season coming in May. We have come across baby raccoons as early as March 1st
and have heard reports of baby raccoons as late as September
Baby Squirrel Removal
Squirrels are most active in late winter. This is when their mating season starts and males are busy chasing females. Babies will come in early spring and again in mid summer.
Baby Skunk Removal
Skunks will typically mate in early spring and have a gestation period of around 66 days. Before the female gives birth she will find a den to house her four to seven kits.
