As your Home and Mold Inspector,  Ambicorp Property Inspections look beyond the aesthetic attributes of a home and inspect for defects or deficiencies that may lead to costly repairs in the future.

As my client, you will have the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on your biggest purchase and investment and the place that you will call home.

    Lab Results Obtained the Next Day - A detailed lab report is provided the next day for Mold Inspections.  In addition to taking mold samples for laboratory analysis, we also do Indoor Air Quality Testing to check for the presence of mold spores in the air.  Samples are sent to our PRO-LAB partners in Vaughan and samples are analyzed for the presence of mold, lead or asbestos.  The lab report details the species of mold, the spore concentration and any known health problems or allergic reactions that may be associated with the mold.   Some people have allergies to pets such as dogs and cats, while others have allergies or concerns about cockroaches, rats, mice and dust mites.  Did you know we also test the air for allergens?  Contact us​ for more details.

Proudly serving clients in the GTA and surrounding areas. 
DSM Property Services is proud to provide our clients with professional, reliable inspection services. All our inspections are conducted by a qualified and fully accredited Registered Home Inspector (RHI) and Certified Thermographer with over 25 years experience in construction and renovation. Our inspection services include:
•	Detailed Inspection of all visible structures and components of a home,
•	Infrared thermal scans* of non-visible structures and components to detect potential issues with moisture, electrical, and insulation  
•	Use of the latest Inspection Technology
•	Repair and cost estimates
•	Recommendations and Maintenance planning
•	A fully detailed and easy to read report of all findings including pictures for quick reference
•	A reference library and links to more detailed information on the components of the home
You also have the option to purchase a detailed Home History Report.
 *Infrared Thermal Scans are part of our premium package and are conducted to detect what the naked eye cannot. This process can identify potential problems in structure, electrical components, insulation, air leakage and moisture content.
An Infrared Scan can:
•	help locate potential safety issues with live electrical equipment, 
•	detect hidden heating and cooling losses, 
•	detect moisture intrusion which could cause mould, 
•	detect inadequate or non-existent insulation, 
•	detect plumbing leaks and poor construction.
•	It could save you in potential repair costs!!
Book a thermal scan inspection:
* Before a warranty inspection
* Before a Real Estate Investment
* Before a contractor begins work
* After a completed project
* As part of a routine maintenance check on your home.

Doing your homework on finding the right Home Inspector is crucial. You need to make sure you are hiring a qualified and experienced Inspector. After all, this person will be providing you with the information you need to make an informed decision about some very costly investments, whether it be the purchase or selling of a home, a new home renovation or existing repair, maintenance of your existing home or potential issues you are having.
We hope that DSM Property Services Inc. can help you with your inspection needs!

Real estate professionals:

For real estate professionals, our work is a commitment to the understanding that their reputation is our responsibility and that a relationship with us reinforces the confidence their clients have in them.

Home buyers:

For the home buyer, our work is an objective explanation of the condition of the potential new home to which an emotional tie is already being formed.

Home sellers:

For the home seller our work is to honor the home they have lived in, and to report on its condition observed at the time of the inspection.

For all of our customers, Pillar To Post considers the home a place of the heart, as it houses the people that are loved and the memories of lifetimes. This is why we call Pillar To Post The Home of Home Inspection.
