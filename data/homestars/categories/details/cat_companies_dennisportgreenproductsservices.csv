CLEAResult is the largest provider of energy efficiency services in North America. We help utilities and governments run energy conservation programs that help business and homeowners save on their bills and increase their building or home's comfort, all while reducing their impact on the environment. Our mission is to change the way people use energy.

- What We Do -

Our energy advisors provide home audits that give you a chance to understand your home in a new light. During the audit, we'll walk through your home, taking pictures and notes of its dimensions, construction materials, and mechanical systems. We'll also perform a blower door test to determine how much air your home leaks. We use this information to breakdown your home's energy use, give it an official energy rating and give you a report on which energy efficient upgrades you should consider for your home.

Our advisors are also able to help you use your audit to apply for up to $5,600 in rebates on qualifying energy-efficient upgrades through Canada's Greener Homes Program and Enbridge's Home Retrofit Program, as well as local and federal zero-interest home loans for energy efficient upgrades (Greener Homes Durham, Toronto Home Energy Loan Program, Better Homes Kingston, Better Homes Ottawa)

Financing - Get access to rebate programs and home upgrade loan programs
Make your home cozier - Pinpoint home comfort issues at the root so you can permanently address them
