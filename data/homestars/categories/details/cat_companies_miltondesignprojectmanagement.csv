​

Mr. Woodhall learned from a very early age what it means to put his customers first and that paying attention to quality no matter the dollar size of the job is essential.

​

Mr. Woodhall first started out in the residential construction field as a flyer delivery boy for his granfather, and then his father. He learned then how to view each project individually when speaking with home owners. He then became a labourer for his family business, and moved to head labourer or supervisor so to speak at a very early age, where he would not only work on the job but have to pay attention to the details of the job being done and  look for new workers for the company.

​

Mr. Woodhall's grandfather and Father made sure that he knew each task from installing decks and fences to roofing, siding, window trim repair, painting and roof framing. When his family had closed down there family business in his early years, Mr. Woodhall then moved on to learn commercial construction in the KW tri-city region and GTA regions, where he learned how to excavate, landscape, and pour concrete.

​

Mr. Woodhall has seen prices sky rocket over the years since he was a young child and he created our company to try and bring top quality to his customers while trying to be able to give reasonable prices.

​

Mr. Woodhall believes that one should not have to sacrifice quality for price, and understand that there is a difference so while using only quality material, Mr. Woodhall will do his best to give a reasonable price for each job.

​

Mr. Woodhall believes in treating each customer and project with true dedication and strives to make sure each customer is satisfied with their project.

Only through the combination of a thorough understanding the of the client’s goals, and achieving high design standards within the real world context of fiscal constraint, complex approvals, and existing urban and/or building fabrics, can an architect maximize the value of a project through his or her involvement.
