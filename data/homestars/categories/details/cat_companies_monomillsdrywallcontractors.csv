At Manor Drywall Systems & Contracting, we cater to projects of all sizes but find that our forte is in smaller projects and repairs. Manor Drywall is owned and operated by Walter Araujo. Walter began Drywalling in 1999 with his father who had a 30 yr career with one of the largest drywalling companies in Canada. After working for drywall companies on multiple commercial & residential projects, in 2015 Walter finally decided that it was time for him to go on his own and that’s when Manor Drywall Systems & Contracting was born. Since then, Walter has built a trusted circle of high quality certified tradesmen that have become part of his team and have helped to make each project they work on a success. 
We love the challenge of new projects that allow us to be creative and innovative where we work directly with our clients as team in delivering exactly what they envision.
