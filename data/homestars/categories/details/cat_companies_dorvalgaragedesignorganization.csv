PVC Slatwall
     1st Choice Garage Outfitters offers PVC Slatwall quite simply because it is the highest quality and most durable garage wall organization and storage solution available. Compared with traditional MDF slatwall or pegboard, PVC Slatwall provides superior durability, flexibility and, important for many people, premium aesthetics.
     PVC Slatwall weighs a fraction of traditional MDF options, minimizing the stress on your walls. Yet has superior weight capacity, maximizing the holding power onto your walls. And, PVC slatwall does not degrade over time.
For non-drywalled garage interiors, PVC slatwall is a viable alternative. The slatwall can be applied on top of drywall or attach directly to studs, replacing the need for drywall if you choose. It is also easily attached directly to concrete walls in areas such as a storage or cold room, creating even more storage capacity in your home.
Cleaning is easy too. Simply hose the wall down or wipe it with a traditional mop broom for a like new finish.
