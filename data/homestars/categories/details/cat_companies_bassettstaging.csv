We strongly intend to develop a closer trust based on a long-term business relationship with our clients. Equally important to us is that our quality of products delivered matches the quality of our service. Our furniture is well maintained and spotless. If an item in our collection is damaged, ripped, broken or stained… it does NOT leave our showroom.
When you team up with Stagers Choice, you get more than a catalog of fine furniture, you get a team of professionals willing to go beyond to help you with your project and make your experience with us efficient & profitable.

We have flexible prices & lease terms and delivery all over GTA is available within 24 hours.

While there are many staging companies on the market, none of them provides the staging quality per dollar we are looking for when we are trying to sell our own property. As such, we see an opportunity to create a better company that provides outstanding staging quality and value than what was available on the market.

R3 Home Staging specializes in providing the highest staging quality per dollar. We strongly believe this is the best way to deliver the best value to our clients.

Through a long streak of wildly successful projects and word of mouth, we are growing faster than we ever anticipated. We believe our integrity, core values and unique presentation styles play a strong part in our rapid growth.

R3 Home Staging provides differentiating designs to showcase a property’s strengths. We understand the market and consistently helps our clients achieve record breaking sale prices in many neighborhoods across GTA.

What makes R3 Home Staging different is we do not cut corners. We treat each property like our own and work diligently to ensure each of our projects meet our high bar of quality and exceptional presentation.
