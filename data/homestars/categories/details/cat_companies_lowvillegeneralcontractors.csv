Basement Finishing in Burlington & Oakville

The kitchen has become the hub of the contemporary household. From involving the whole family in cooking nightly meals to a room without distractions for children to do homework to the perfect setting for a wine and cheese party, kitchens are more important than ever to the 21st century lifestyle. Whether you’re looking to completely overhaul your outdated kitchen or replace individual features such as kitchen cabinets or flooring, Red Stone Contracting Inc. will help you to realize your kitchen renovation vision.
What Can a Red Stone Contracting Inc. Kitchen Renovation Do For You?
The kitchen is undeniably one of the most important rooms in your home. Its complex utility systems and requirements for both style and function necessitate careful placement and focused attention to the individualized needs of each client. Here are just a few of the features that will be considered during a kitchen renovation to help to transform your kitchen into an inviting, functional space.
Layout – Decades of kitchen additions and new afppliances often result in a confusing and ineffective kitchen layout. Our design experts will help you to determine the right floor plan to improve your kitchen’s workflow, lessening stress and wasted time in the kitchen.
Updated Appliances – Many kitchens feature a hodgepodge of appliances and utilities from several different decades. Not only do these strange bedfellows clash stylistically, but they also don’t offer the best performance or highest energy efficiency. Installing modern stoves, refrigerators, dishwashers, and sinks will slash your utility bills and provide the basis for your kitchen’s beautiful new aesthetic.
Kitchen Cabinets – Expand your cluttered kitchen’s storage space with high-quality, durable, and beautiful kitchen cabinets. Our handcrafted cabinets provide innovative storage solutions and lend stunning style to your kitchen, freeing up counter space for food preparation and entertaining and enhancing your kitchen’s contemporary, traditional, or whimsical aesthetic.
At Red Stone Contracting Inc., we believe that the key to a successful kitchen renovation is planning and communication. That’s why we encourage our clients to articulate their specific needs and budgetary restrictions from the get-go. We know that no one understands your individual style or workspace needs better than you. For full kitchen renovations, we let our clients choose to either work with one of our trusted and experienced design consultants or hire their own. Either way, Red Stone Contracting Inc. will accommodate your preferences and work within the design, style, and budgetary parameters of your choosing.

Basements are quickly becoming the new living room: a space for the family to relax and unwind after a long day. Basements don’t have to be musty, dreary storage rooms for old, broken furniture and unused appliances. Red Stone Contracting Inc.’s basement finishing services can turn your dripping, mouldy basement into a dry, warm space for entertaining and living.
Why is Basement Finishing Ideal for the Modern Home?
Modern homeowners often cite storage and space as two of their top issues. If you’re looking for more space in your home but want to avoid the high costs associated with building an addition, basement finishing helps you to utilize what space your home already offers by transforming it into a recreation room, guest suite, home theatre, bar, home office, personal gym, spare kitchen or bathroom, or any other space you can imagine. While rooms above stairs are often reserved for formal get-togethers, basement finishing provides space in your home for more casual entertaining, cozy and private family-only space, or groups of loud teenagers.
Why Choose Red Stone Contracting Inc. for your Basement Finishing?
Basement finishing is unlike any other home renovation project, but many companies treat the basement like any other in the house. They end up using materials that aren’t waterproof and that soon deteriorate in your basement’s climate. At Red Stone Contracting Inc., we understand what it takes to renovate every room in your home. We strive to use high-quality and durable waterproofing materials that will withstand the worst of what the Oakville and Burlington weather has to offer. Basements are often the centre of your home’s utilities and store such vital equipment as your furnace and water heater. Our expert staff understands how to work around these fixtures so that they continue to function as normal, but do not obstruct your beautiful new design.
The under-utilized basement is among the most versatile and customizable spaces in the modern home. Every homeowner’s vision for their completed basement finishing project is vastly different, which is why we offer so many flooring options including wood, tile, parquet, and carpet, endless paint colours and finishes for your wall panels, a variety of crown moulding designs and ceiling tiles, and numerous options for lighting from suspended lighting to task and pendant lights. The basement of your dreams is within your reach. Contact the dedicated and passionate home improvement experts at Red Stone Contracting Inc. today to bring your kitchen renovation, basement finishing, or bathroom renovation vision to life.

Kitchen Cabinets in Burlington & Oakville

Tile Installation in Burlington & Oakville
Not much is less appealing than dirty and deteriorating flooring or walls. Family members and guests will be loath to step on stained carpeting, tiling with mouldy or dirty grout, or pieces of broken-off wall. Update your home with a beautiful new tile installation from the flooring experts at Red Stone Contractors. From design to installation, our highly trained staff will ensure that the tile installation for your kitchen, hearth, patio, or bathroom renovation fits your needs in terms of function, style, and finance.
What are the Benefits of a Tile Installation from Red Stone Contracting Inc.?
Flooring and walling are often at the very back of our minds until something goes wrong. Flooring plays a vital role in the look and feel of a room, either enhancing its aesthetic and design or detracting from it while varying tile wall textures add elegance and sophistication to any room. Tile is ideal for surfaces that are constantly splashed with water and need to undergo regular cleaning such as kitchen and bathroom floors. Our materials comply with the latest industry standards for durability, ease of maintenance, and water resistance, and our cost-efficient and high-quality tile installation will last for decades, despite the unforgiving climates of your bathroom or kitchen.
Flooring and walling are dramatic and powerful design elements that bring cohesion and flow to every other feature in a room. At Red Stone Contracting Inc., we offer the latest trends in our tile installation to complement your home’s style. Choose from among our many tile materials and aesthetics.
Ceramic – This clay tile is among the most popular and versatile floor materials. It can be characterized either as porcelain – which gives the tiles a glassy appearance — or non-porcelain.
Stone – Classic natural stones such as marble, granite, slate, and limestone add instant elegance to any room’s flooring or walls.
Shapes – Tiles can be cut into octagons, circles, diamonds, rectangles, or a wide range of other shapes to fit your design preferences.
Colours and Finishes – While neutral tile tones allow you to play up other design elements, brightly coloured tile can be a bold statement or add character to a kitchen or bathroom. Choose from shiny acid wash finishes, weather brushed finishes or rough split-faced finishes that add texture to your home.
Begin your bathroom or kitchen renovation project with tile installation from Red Stone Contractors. For over 10 years, Oakville and Burlington residents have trusted our attentive and dedicated staff with their home improvement projects.

Basements are quickly becoming the new living room: a space for the family to relax and unwind after a long day. Basements don’t have to be musty, dreary storage rooms for old, broken furniture and unused appliances. Red Stone Contracting Inc.’s basement finishing services can turn your dripping, mouldy basement into a dry, warm space for entertaining and living.
Why is Basement Finishing Ideal for the Modern Home?
Modern homeowners often cite storage and space as two of their top issues. If you’re looking for more space in your home but want to avoid the high costs associated with building an addition, basement finishing helps you to utilize what space your home already offers by transforming it into a recreation room, guest suite, home theatre, bar, home office, personal gym, spare kitchen or bathroom, or any other space you can imagine. While rooms above stairs are often reserved for formal get-togethers, basement finishing provides space in your home for more casual entertaining, cozy and private family-only space, or groups of loud teenagers.
Why Choose Red Stone Contracting Inc. for your Basement Finishing?
Basement finishing is unlike any other home renovation project, but many companies treat the basement like any other in the house. They end up using materials that aren’t waterproof and that soon deteriorate in your basement’s climate. At Red Stone Contracting Inc., we understand what it takes to renovate every room in your home. We strive to use high-quality and durable waterproofing materials that will withstand the worst of what the Oakville and Burlington weather has to offer. Basements are often the centre of your home’s utilities and store such vital equipment as your furnace and water heater. Our expert staff understands how to work around these fixtures so that they continue to function as normal, but do not obstruct your beautiful new design.
The under-utilized basement is among the most versatile and customizable spaces in the modern home. Every homeowner’s vision for their completed basement finishing project is vastly different, which is why we offer so many flooring options including wood, tile, parquet, and carpet, endless paint colours and finishes for your wall panels, a variety of crown moulding designs and ceiling tiles, and numerous options for lighting from suspended lighting to task and pendant lights. The basement of your dreams is within your reach. Contact the dedicated and passionate home improvement experts at Red Stone Contracting Inc. today to bring your kitchen renovation, basement finishing, or bathroom renovation vision to life.

Kitchen Renovation in Burlington & Oakville
The kitchen has become the hub of the contemporary household. From involving the whole family in cooking nightly meals to a room without distractions for children to do homework to the perfect setting for a wine and cheese party, kitchens are more important than ever to the 21st century lifestyle. Whether you’re looking to completely overhaul your outdated kitchen or replace individual features such as kitchen cabinets or flooring, Red Stone Contracting Inc. will help you to realize your kitchen renovation vision.
What Can a Red Stone Contracting Inc. Kitchen Renovation Do For You?
The kitchen is undeniably one of the most important rooms in your home. Its complex utility systems and requirements for both style and function necessitate careful placement and focused attention to the individualized needs of each client. Here are just a few of the features that will be considered during a kitchen renovation to help to transform your kitchen into an inviting, functional space.
Layout – Decades of kitchen additions and new afppliances often result in a confusing and ineffective kitchen layout. Our design experts will help you to determine the right floor plan to improve your kitchen’s workflow, lessening stress and wasted time in the kitchen.
Updated Appliances – Many kitchens feature a hodgepodge of appliances and utilities from several different decades. Not only do these strange bedfellows clash stylistically, but they also don’t offer the best performance or highest energy efficiency. Installing modern stoves, refrigerators, dishwashers, and sinks will slash your utility bills and provide the basis for your kitchen’s beautiful new aesthetic.
Kitchen Cabinets – Expand your cluttered kitchen’s storage space with high-quality, durable, and beautiful kitchen cabinets. Our handcrafted cabinets provide innovative storage solutions and lend stunning style to your kitchen, freeing up counter space for food preparation and entertaining and enhancing your kitchen’s contemporary, traditional, or whimsical aesthetic.
At Red Stone Contracting Inc., we believe that the key to a successful kitchen renovation is planning and communication. That’s why we encourage our clients to articulate their specific needs and budgetary restrictions from the get-go. We know that no one understands your individual style or workspace needs better than you. For full kitchen renovations, we let our clients choose to either work with one of our trusted and experienced design consultants or hire their own. Either way, Red Stone Contracting Inc. will accommodate your preferences and work within the design, style, and budgetary parameters of your choosing.

Roger Caissie came to Toronto from New Brunswick when he was just 16. Right off the bat, he took a couple of odd jobs as a handyman, eventually only to join his brother and his partner Ray in their drywall and taping business. With time, Roger grew to learn more about not just drywalling and taping but also about other aspects of construction. 

Once he had several years of experience under his belt and had been exposed to all aspects of construction and home renovation, Roger founded RJ Renovations.

At RJ Renovations, Roger didn’t want to force his choices on his clients, like the rest of his competition did to make more money. He wanted to leave that choice entirely to the customer so they could build something of their imagination and stay within their budget. Roger also operated with his mantra, which eventually became the business’ mantra: Doing it right the first time is cheaper than doing it over. This is why Roger and his entire team don’t believe in taking shortcuts when working on a project. They do things the right way first time around which leads to total and complete customer satisfaction by the end of the project. 

Roger’s a seasoned trades person with over 45 years in the industry, all by himself. Couple that with the experience of the rest of his team and we’re talking over 75 years of hard earned experience in construction and home renovations, but more importantly in helping people realize their home renovation dreams.

THE COLLECTIVE CONNECTION PROCESS
We created The Collective Connection Process™ based on our experience working with thousands of clients over many years. We’ve learned that some people do not achieve the best outcomes with their interior designer or contractor because they did not connect first with what they really wanted emotionally. We call this The Disconnected Design Trap™. When you fall into this trap, you waste a lot of time and money, feel stressed, and worried and ultimately do not achieve your vision. This is why we created The Collective Connection Process™.  To get a better outcome, we learned it's important to connect first with what you really want emotionally. By engaging in a Collective Connection Conversation you are taking the first step to avoid the Disconnected Design Trap.  You will feel more relaxed and confident. And you will achieve your vision.
