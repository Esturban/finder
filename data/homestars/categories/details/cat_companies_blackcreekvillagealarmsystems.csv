By strategically locating devices designed to detect intrusion, Safetech's acquired a unique ability to successfully protect both people and property. By blending together different security technologies and procedures we achieve the highest security standard possible with the lowest “rate of loss” among our clients in the industry.
 
Only by taking a comprehensive integrated security approach to the needs of our clients can the best results be achieved. For instance, statistically adding an alarm will reduce a chance of a ‘break and enter’ by 10x when compared with a home that has no alarm system. However, if you combine one or more surveillance tools together, such as an alarm system combined with video surveillance cameras, your chance of a ‘break and enter’ is reduced by 40x when compared with an unprotected property.
 
Furthermore, even if you do end up being a victim of a ‘break and enter’ the amount of property stolen is 50% less than it would be if the premise only had an alarm system. Compare this to a property that has little or no protection (no alarm or video cameras) the savings are even greater, with a total 80% reduction in loss of property value. Therefore, security surveillance tools work even better when used in tandem to prevent property loss and are a very effective way of deterring and reducing crime.
 
Good Protection Starts with Good Design
 
Safetech loss prevention advisors are trained to ensure clients receive proper security coverage using the significant arsenal of security tools and techniques they have at their disposal.
 
An advisor will begin first by having a detailed discussion with our potential clients to determine their specific application and security needs. Once an advisor is satisfied that they have an understanding of the clients needs a security solution will be recommended. There is absolutely ‘no obligation’ to follow any recommendation given and there is no charge for our security evaluation.
 
Good protection may start with good design but it can only be maintained with good monitoring and management procedures.Most people think that a 24 hour monitoring station exists solely to respond to emergency signals. However, equally important is the need to respond to no signals when one is expected, or to trouble signals coming from the control panel.
 
A trouble condition may arise when a client’s alarm panel fails to send its scheduled weekly test signal to the monitoring station, or, if it sends a signal indicating that the power has failed or the back up battery is low. “How quickly a security company deciphers and responds to these conditions is a true measure of the quality of their service”.

Sales person won't leave when you tell them ""No Thanks""
Sales person won't leave when you say ""I Already Have Your Products or Service""

The President and founder, Tom Reimer established the business in 1986 after a personal experience of having to break into his own home after losing his keys. The point of entry was through the basement window which provided easy access. It became immediately obvious that the basement windows were very vulnerable to break and enter. Tom devised a metal window guard for his windows and, subsequently, half the neighbourhood! Hence, Metalex Security Products was born.

You can get help when you need it - with 24/7 professional monitoring, you’ll get notifications if unexpected events occur, and our security experts are ready to send emergency services if needed.

From the very beginning, ACA Tech Inc. has striven to establish itself as a “quality company”. Over the years, we have built up an impressive customer base including, but not limited to, local businesses in Toronto and throughout the GTA. We have achieved the quality standard for all of our clients who continue to be protected daily. If you are looking for security services for your home or your business, please contact us to get a free consultation on how we can help you or your business stay secure.
 
Alarm Systems
An alarm system is an absolute must for any private property, especially homes. We can set up an alarm system that secures your house or office everytime you leave and makes sure only the right people come in. If a certain time limit has reached without the alarm system being turned off after an entry, the monitoring station will immediatly try to contact you to make sure its not a false alarm and then proceed to call law enforcement if necessary. An ideal way to secure your property.
 
CCTV / Video Surveillance
Video surveillance systems and CCTV allow you to keep a close eye on your property – whether that be a house, apartment building, office, or factory. We offer a multitude of options, including live and recorded high-resolution streaming and viewing as well as remote live streaming that can be watched on your computer, tablet, and phone.
 
Access Control
Access control can limit who can access what areas, provide records of who entered and left the premises and when, and can offer a hierachy of clearance for specific areas. This helps protect apartment buildings, offices, and other secure or private areas. Unlike keys, which can be easily copied or lost, we can set up an access control system that makes sure that your security is not compromised.
 
Biometric Scanners
Biometrics is an extra layer of security that builds off of access control. With biometrics, you are the password. Your fingerprint will be the key to access doors, safes, and other secure areas. Biometrics also makes the entire system more trustworthy, as the identity of who accesses specific areas are instantly validated with their print. Biometrics can also be added, cancelled, and managed with the click of a button – giving you all the control you need.
 
Networking
If your business has more than one computer and employee, chances are that you could benefit from networking them. By setting up a local area network (LAN), we can connect your company’s computers and allow them to share and exchange any type of information – whether that be images, files, or documents. This can also allow the sharing of a printer as well as remote access from out of the office.
 
Medical Security and Safety
Medical issues and complications can definitely have an impact on your independence and peace of mind. With a medical security system, we can provide emergency response with a push of a button. It also provides a two-way voice system with professional operators who are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Once an operators has determined your situation, they can reach out to family, friends, neighbours, or even emergency personnel if necessary. 
 
Telephone Entry
With the use of telephone entry, usually paired with some sort of access control system in place, we can help secure a building and also offer a convenient way to provide access. Whether its an apartment building, high-rise office, or even a storefront – we can help protect your tenants and property from potential unauthorized intruders.
 
Home Automation
Technology is getting more and more integrated into our lives everyday, giving us more control than ever before. Your home – its lighting, speakers, heating and air cooling systems, and appliances – can also be controlled directly from your phone or tablet. It’s a convenient and efficient way to control your home and what goes on in it.",aca-technology,2017-08-08T15:22:30.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,"CCTV, Alarm Systems, Access Control, Home Automation, Computer Networking, Biometrics, Telephone Entry, and Medical Alert Systems","Honeywell, Digital Watchdogs, HAI, DSC, Paradox, HIKVISION, American Dynamics, BOSCH, CDVI, Cansec, Kantech, Dahua",,2006,6,"E-Transfer, Cash, Cheque, Visa & Mastercard",,,,TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Yes, ask for details.

We do not pay the monthly fee to be on Homestars, therefore I can't add my LOGO & some other features are disabled (no link to website) 
The fact that we do not pay monthly fees for this review service means we can charge our customers a bit less then our competition to get the jobs done.

    We will then locate the animal, determine if it is breeding, and assess the best method to get them out.

Effective Removal of Wildlife

    Our technicians will gain access to the animal and use various hands-on techniques to remove it (and babies if applicable).

Wildlife Exclusion

    We will conduct a 50-point damage inspection and advise you of any repairs that are required.
    Our wildlife technicians will seal all the potential openings in your building with heavy gauge wire screening and/or silicone caulking if required.

Why the Humane Approach is Better

Our wildlife technicians are specially trained to remove wildlife and prevent undue stress or injury to the animals. This is also a practical and economical approach. The inhumane killing, trapping or relocation of animals is illegal. Removing mothers leaves the babies to die in your building. The removal of carcasses is time consuming, costly and poses a health risk. Our focus on education and prevention makes us a leader in the wildlife control industry.

Why Choose Affordable Wildlife Control?

    The Ontario ministry of natural resources licenses us.
    We provide permanent solutions to your wildlife problems.
    We are continuously updating are equipment and techniques to keep us on the cutting edge of wildlife control.
    We use only the highest quality materials in our repairs of your home or business.
    We strive to make our repairs match your house and to be as unnoticeable as possible.
    We treat all animals as humanly as possible.
    Last but least we are AFFORDABLE.
