Gas Fireplace Pro is one of the services provided by Barbeque Pro Inc. We specialize in the cleaning and maintenance of gas fireplaces. Our gas licensed technicians have been trained to clean, repair and safety inspect all makes and models. Our approach in business is not to up-sell and run, but instead to build long lasting relationships with our clients and help them maintain their original investment at a low cost for many years to come. 

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

At Gas Fireplace Pro our main focus is not selling and installing new gas fireplaces units. We do carry new products and can assist our customers when needed, however, we pride ourselves on restoring and repairing what you already have so you can avoid expensive replacement costs.
