Whether you are a Homeowner involved in remodeling, renovating or retrofitting your home, or an Industry Professional or Contractor looking for a reputable insulation contractor for your next project, we can deliver reliable and prompt service at a competitive price, using only the highest quality Canadian-manufactured cellulose insulation on the market today. 
With the cost of living skyrocketing, saving money by saving energy has never been more important. Heating and cooling costs can account for 50-70% of a home or building’s yearly energy expense. When installed correctly, insulation is the simplest and most cost-effective means to lower this energy use. Remember, sealing and ventilating your home correctly will not only keep you warm in winter but will also cool you down in the summer months… Insulation is the perfect four season solution to saving you money.
If you are working on a “Green Building” project, or consider environmental sustainability a factor in your decision-making when selecting an insulation installer, please contact us. We choose to install Climatizer Plus™ cellulose insulation for its superior thermal and acoustical performance as well as its environmental benefits. Climatizer Plus loose-fill cellulose is certified by UL’s ECOLOGO program; indicating that this product has undergone rigorous scientific testing, auditing, or both, to prove its compliance with stringent, third party, environmental performance standards and may help you contribute to LEED credit categories.   
Call us or “Get started today” on our website and allow us to provide you the information you need to make an informed choice for your home or building insulation needs.  We offer free in-home assessments and quotes.

Do you need a Full Home Renovation, New Construction, Extension, Addition, Second Floor, Basement or Kitchen Renovation?

We begin with a Free Consultation in your Home. We want to learn about your current layout, design and structural features. We also want to know what you do and don't like about your home. Next our Designer will do an extensive brainstorming of possible designs, colour tones and layouts. She will put together a proposal and recommend what styles go well with your home and preferences. The planning and design is the most important part of a home renovation. 

Next we have a Contractor with over 40 years of construction experience in Toronto. He will look at all the structural changes, interior and exterior finishes etc. to calculate your construction cost. We work with you and make adjustments until you are satisfied with the scope of your renovation and budget. Everything is on paper, we do not touch your home until you give us your approval. 

We then put together a rigid timeline and schedule. Materials are sourced and contractors begin their work. To keep your money safe, we want to minimize up front deposits and pay progress payments only after each stage is completed. Our goal is to keep you informed throughout the entire process, whilst allowing you to focus on your daily work, family and social life.

Welcome to Mignon Interiors, where we stand by our reputation. We are dedicated to giving you a positive experience and make sure you will be thrilled with your Brand New Home.",mignon-interiors,2022-06-15T20:00:39.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Full Home Renovation
