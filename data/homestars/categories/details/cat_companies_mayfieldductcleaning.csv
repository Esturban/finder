CUSTOMER TIP: Did you know that any technician that enters your home (in Ontario) to provide a furnace cleaning MUST have at least a G3 gas fitters certificate authorized by the TSSA. Don't be fooled by any other certifications acquired through associations other than TSSA. These certificates can normally be acquired quickly without a regulatory body. Remember to ask your technician for an original copy of their Ontario Certificate Of Qualification before beginning work in your home. Safety First....

****WE DO NOT USE TELEMARKETERS.  PLEASE DO NOT BE FOOLED BY TELEMARKETERS CALLING AND SAYING THEY ARE US.*****

What about Capps:
We have been in business since the 1990's and we are family owned and operated. Our Owners are hands on employees with valid TSSA certification and all of our staff have been well trained to the highest standards for our customers. No partial jobs, no short cuts we do every home as if it was our children and grandchildren living in your environment.

***HIRE THE EXPERIENCED AND GET THE RESULTS YOU EXPECT***

What to look for when hiring a Duct Cleaning Company 
- Not all Duct Cleaners are created equal.
Make sure the company coming to your home are professional, well trained and properly certified to complete all the work.
We have all heard the horror stories either from friends, neighbors, family member and customers or have seen the news related stories on Television of those ""Duct Cleaners"" who do not take pride in their work or are out to make a fast buck from the non-suspecting public. We at Capps face this situation almost every day when we hear from dissatisfied people who have had the ducts unsatisfactorily cleaned by one of these outfits. We are often called upon to redo residential homes and business's that were not done right the first time.
Your first clue you are hiring the wrong company should be the price they quote you. This old adage applies ""you get what you pay for"".  In this day and age with the cost of having experienced and professional staff, the cost of fuel, insurance and related operating costs, how can anyone clean your home and do it right the first time for less than $249.00. The answer is, they don't have the experienced and properly trained/certified people, the right and well maintained equipment and don't take the time to do the job properly. In fact a lot of individuals just don't know the proper procedures. Also, just because they say they are members of an association does not make them a professional at what they do. Another point is they low ball you only to get their foot in the door.  Some firms even have two services, one for partial cleaning and one to clean everything, usually it turns out to be everything when they show up. This amazes us, how can you just clean part of your system, it is like washing you feet and putting dirty socks back on. 
These points are  very important as this is your home, where you and your families spend a good portion of your life.  Therefore, the  Environment you live and breath in should be a major concern for you. 
If you have had your ducts cleaned recently or in the past year or two here are some points to consider:
- Did the Technician present you with proper certification and take the time to walk you through the process either before or after the job. Some sort of Inspection should be done with you to keep you in the loop and confirm in your mind the job was done right.
- when duct cleaning is complete walk around taping duct work in certain places (our staff will do this with you), and if you hear stuff jumping around inside, the job was not done right.
-it's a new home it should be clean. Really, it would amaze you to see the undesirable things we consistently pull out of the ducting in new homes. Even those that say the ducts have been cleaned.

Our services included the cleaning of your entire ducting system from supplies to cold air returns, we go to every vent in the house with our air supply and vacuum to make sure that each run of ducting is cleaned thoroughly, starting on the top floor, working our way down into the basement.  We actually send our air hose down every set of ducts in your home to make sure it is cleaned thorough, ""no quick blow and go"" is done by our staff. In addition a full furnace compartment cleaning will be done, which includes blowing out the compartment itself along with the fan area and upon completion a  disinfectant /sanitizer  http://www.benefect.com/US_benefect/US_products_disinfectants.php will be added to the duct work to help prevent any future possibility of any bacteria or mold in the duct work.  

There are no hidden costs or hook up fees with use. The only thing extra is the tax which the government wants use to collect for them.

Do we have additional services you can pay for while we are there? Yes, if the filter(s) need replacing we will tell you. You can buy from us or pick one up at your favourite home supply. If you chose to buy one elsewhere we will clean the existing one for you.

Other services available that are not typically part of the Duct Cleaning System Cleaning, at addition cost, are the Dryer Venting and the Cleaning of the Air Conditioning Evaporator and Condenser units. These can be done at another time but the pricing is greatly reduced if you chose to have them done at the same time as the duct cleaning.

Included in every service: FREE air flow optimization! & FREE humidifier inspection

We also install Hepa Filtering Systems and Humidifiers, and these have to be specifically quoted based on the individual home requirements.

At Capps our work is done with satisfaction guaranteed!  If for any reason (within 30 days) you are unsatisfied with the work done, we will return and do it again at no charge to you.

***PLEASE NOTE: WE DO NOT USE TELEMARKETERS, sub-contractors or call people for business.  Our business booms on our reputation and word of mouth alone.
***DON'T BE FOOLED BY TELEMARKETERS CALLING AND SAYING THEY ARE US.   The only way we will call you is if you have asked us to.***",capps-duct-cleaning-services-inc,2008-01-23T10:24:20.000-05:00,NA,"***WE SERVICE THE GTA AND SURROUNDING AREAS***
<br />***HIRE THE EXPERIENCED AND GET THE RESULTS YOU EXPECT***<br/>

<br/>At Capps we ""DO NOT"" telemarket for new business,  and we do not sub work out to others.
<br />So if you get a call from someone claiming to be from Capps looking to sell you duct cleaning it is probably not Capps.  Capps does call pervious customers to remind them it may be time to have their cleaning done again. This is usually only every 2-5 years depending on individual home circumstances and this is indicated on a sticker we leave on furnace ducting.
<br />We also call customers to confirm apointment and to follow up on work already completed to insure complete customer satisfaction<br/>

Duct Cleaning
Our 10-step Duct Cleaning process: 
1. Monster Vacuum. Our Goal is to remove all the dirt and dust. The truck-vac system is among the most powerful system in Ontario. 20 bags with a 56 horsepower engine for PULL and 300psi for PUSH give us the best performance. 2. Trained Technicians. No sub-contractors or one-man operators in Comfort Clean Corporation. Our specialists are experienced in the latest procedures and most effective cleaning tools. 
3. Setup & Protection. Work will not begin until the floors, doorways, and corners protected against dirt and scratching. No shoes are worn at all times. 
4. Negative Air Pressure. The 8′ vacuum hose is attached to both the supply and return sides of the system. During the cleaning, all dirt and debris is pulled directly to the vac-truck. 
5. Maximizing Vacuum. All registers are covered with magnetic vinyl sheets. As each run is cleaned, the cover is removed, maximizing the air flow in that duct line. 
6.Scrubbing the System. Pulling large volumes of air toward the truck, we now send our scrubbing tools (300psi) down each supply run to remove every trace of dirt and dust. 
7. Cold Air Returns. Once all the supply registers are clean, we move to the return air system. this includes all the grill covers and drops throughout the house. 
8. Trunks & Plenums. All trunks lines (supply) and plenums (return) are cleaned with special skipper ball technology. Secially designed plastic insure there’s no air flow loss. 
9. Blower Interior. The cleaning is completed with the air-washing and vacuum of the drop, filter box, blower fan, cabinet interior. 
10. Wrapping It Up. New galvanized access panels are installed over the openings created for the vacuum hose.

Dryer Vent Cleaning
A plugged dryer vent can cause excessive heat build up within the vent itself and the drying appliance , resulting in possible fire.
At Comfort Clean we can help you avoid disaster. Our expert technicians and top of the line equipment will completely remove the flamable lint from your dryer vents, eliminatin the possibility of ignition and damage to the dryer itself.

Carpet & Oriental Rug Cleaning
At Comfort Clean, each rug receives individual attention. We will pick up your oriental rug from the comfort of your home, clean it in our state-of-the-art facility and return it back to you in the shortest account of time.
Our experienced cleaning crew handle carpets and rugs from all over the world. While most companies will only clean the surface of your rug, we will perform complete, deep-penetrating washing of both sides of your rug. In addition we can repair, reweave, refringe and resurge any kind of rug.
Our approach to cleaning oriental rugs combines old world craftsmanship with new technology.

Duct Cleaning
We clean all supply and return ducting throughout the entire home or building, including all registers, grilles, and/or diffusers.  We also clean all filters, blower sections and their components and disinfect entire ducting upon completion.


***
Dryer vent
We clean all exhaust ducting, lint traps and fans connected to commercial dryers. We do this for Hotels, Laundromats, Hospitals/Retirement/Nursing Homes and Fitness Facilities.  
Dryer vents should be cleaned on a regular basis to help eliminate any potential fires, as well as decrease drying time, reduce repair costs and greatly improve air quality.
Lint is combustible and when dryers can't expel hot air due to being clogged with lint, they can become less efficient, damaged and a serious fire may start as a result of this causing major property damage. Dryer damage and fires can be prevented with proper maintenance.
***
Exhaust Cleaning
Cleaning of exhaust fans and ducting connected to laboratories, washrooms, equipment, etc.
***

COMMERCIAL
Duct Cleaning 
We clean the duct work in Office buildings, Schools, Daycares, Condominiums, Warehouses, Retail Stores, Recreational Facilities and a variety of commercial environments.
