Wilma was born and raised in Bowmanville.  She gained valuable customer service experience at an early age, working at Carnation Flower Shop (a Bowmanville business established by her parents), until graduating from Durham College with a diploma in Business Accounting.

In 1986, Wilma married, moved to Newcastle and started her own business, Sensational Seams, designing and sewing unique and creative drapery in her Workroom Studio. The business soon grew, with Wilma’s personal motto to never do the same thing twice in her 35 year sewing experience. She became certified to install HunterDouglas window treatments.  She feels blessed by the wonderful clientele that she has worked with who continue to refer her to their friends and family.  She is also excited that the business has grown into a family business, with her husband and both daughters supporting her, working alongside her and bringing to the table their own gifts and talents that the business is benefiting from. This creates a personal look and service for your project – Just For YOU!

Wilma has achieved several mile-stones in her career.  She won first place in the Great Window Covering Challenge Across Canada, a competition involving designing treatments for arch, bay and other challenging window shapes. She received a Clarington Newspaper Readers’ Choice Award in the Best Drapery category.  She also won the Creative Customer Design Award, Customer Acceptance Award, and Sales Leader of the Year through Exciting Windows!

Wilma has served more than 1,000 clients over her career, primarily working on the homes and offices of CEOs, doctors, lawyers, developers and other professionals, as well as commercial buildings, such as schools, churches, retirement and condominium complexes.",sensational-seams,2008-03-04T16:55:15.000-05:00,NA,NA,By Appointment Only,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,1721444,Sensational Seams,1,1,0,10,"Drapery & Curtains, Drapery, Custom Drapery, Blinds, Curtain Rods, Drapery Hardware, Curtain stores, Drapes, custom window coverings, drapery fabric, soft furnishings, roman blinds, custom blinds,  custom curtains, the curtain, curtain, curtains, drapery, drapes, drapery curtain, curtain drapery, drapery and curtain, curtain and drapery, drapery curtains, curtains and drapery, curtains drapery, drapery and curtains, valence, drapes and curtains, curtains drapes, curtains & drapes, curtains and drapes, drapes curtains, drapes & curtains, draperies, curtain and drapes, ,",0,2014-09-04T08:06:17.000-04:00,FALSE,0,0,0,FALSE,2d6e3b644b9262b21430ae6eb6492f3bf469aac6,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,1671596,80.9629293984,343,NA,NA
