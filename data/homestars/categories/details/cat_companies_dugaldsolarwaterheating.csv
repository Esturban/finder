INDOOR AIR QUALITY:
Not to be a killjoy, but are you inside? If so, you most likely be surprised if you realized how many toxins you may have just inhaled, including chemical vapors, microbes, mildew, viruses, bacteria, dust, dirt, pollen, allergens and more. Hold on...what?

The EPA discovered in a survey that Americans spend 87% of their lives inside, and that indoor air pollutant levels are up to 100 times higher than pollution levels found outside. Yikes! Now think about the fact that people breathe an estimated 3,000 gallons of air every single day. So do your kids. So does your Pug. Seriously, we need to stop taking indoor air quality for granted. Not anymore. ",winnipeg-supply-service-experts,2008-03-04T16:55:15.000-05:00,NA,,,,"Furnace Repair Service
