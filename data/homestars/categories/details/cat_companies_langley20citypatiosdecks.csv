Company Founder- Shayne Finskars
Shayne started general construction by taking on residential renovations in his first home and using his lengthy carpentry and construction experience to conduct the renovations. During this time he gained recognition from family, friends and others over social media for the custom look and quality of these renovations. Many neighbours, friends and acquaintances asked him to take on the general contractor role for their renovations, provide advice or take on the project completely. He gained significant experience and furthered his education in the renovation and building science fields. As a result, he has taken on a number of general contractor projects while supplementing his knowledge through general residential construction course work and supply management research. As a result Shayne has gained a great appreciation for the general contracting process, attained significant knowledge on a variety of construction materials, and developed significant relationships with clientele. The progression/development in modern building sciences, and being able to build beautiful projects have motivated him to do outstanding work. Shayne loves seeing the smiles and joy that people get when they see their finished project and continues to be fascinated by new product lines, designs and ingenuity in construction by always seeking to create beautiful, quality, sustainable, cost effective construction solutions while ensuring customers are ecstatic in the reveal of the final product.

How we got started:

After only 8 years of our own sundecks being resurfaced, they needed to be done again. We have 3 decks totaling about 1,000 square feet and we were frustrated that the last re-coating only lasted a short time. We also knew that we needed to resurface the decks on some of our rental properties. We did a lot of research, thinking there had to be a better solution.
We discovered polyurethane. Thank goodness for our rental properties because the first applications were a challenge. We were pleased that we could seal around wooden railing posts and bond to the stucco siding, without it having to be removed. We even coated the stairs! Our first applications do not look as good as they do today, but they have lasted! No rips, tears or leaks.

We decided that homeowners, like us, would want a coating that would first and foremost, be waterproof and last. Our decks are done by hand. Each one is unique. After resurfacing decks for our families and friends, word started to spread. NewPort Dry Deck was born, and we couldn’t be happier.

We take a lot of pride knowing your family home will remain protected from the elements for well over 20 years.",newport-dry-deck,2013-04-17T12:56:33.000-04:00,NA,NA,,"Moisture Cured Polyurethane with two different finishes.
