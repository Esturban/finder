They are pulled in all directions trying to be everything to everyone. At Captain Handy Co, we focus on one customer, you, the homeowner. We have a singular focus on bringing you the best landscaping and interior renovation, the best customer service, and the best value for your home.

Whatever your outdoor lighting needs, we have the experience and expertise to get it done right the first time.

WHAT WE DO:

We want to transform your outdoor living spaces in the best way possible. Some of our exquisite outdoor lighting options include:

-Accent lighting to subtly show off your property’s best features
-Architectural lighting to highlight your home’s unique beauty
-Pool lighting to keep your nightly swims safe
-Patio and deck lights to add excitement to your nighttime entertaining
-Garden lighting to accentuate your stunning landscaping
-Path lighting to guide your guests where they need to go
-Up-lighting for home facade, trees, and outdoor artwork

From a single small garden that needs just a touch of light, to a sprawling estate home that needs lighting with zone control automation, we offer it all.

Call us today for a free at-home consultation, and one of our lighting designers will make a customs lighting design for your unique property.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:

We are dedicated outdoor lighting designers and installers. We do one thing, and we do it the best. We aren't a sprinkler company or lawn care company moonlighting in outdoor lights when times are slow. We will be here to take the call when your lights need maintenance years down the road.

We manufacture our lights by hand, mostly in the United States but some right here in Toronto, so we can control the entire chain of quality from raw materials to your beautiful garden. 

Our designers, installers, and service crews are all our own staff: we do not use sub-contractors. With Outdoor Lighting Perspectives, your satisfaction is guaranteed in writing and backed by our 30 year on-site warranty.

THE TRUSTWORTHY CHOICE:

How can you find an outdoor lighting contractor you can trust to get the work done right, on time, and safely? 

We have been independently vetted by a third-party for our complete and up-to-date liability insurance and workers compensation coverage, our safety and training compliance, and our long established track record of happy customer referrals and testimonials. 

Companies claiming to do lighting come and go, but we're celebrating 20 years and our warranty is backed by our international network of 60+ locations. We'll install your lights today, but we'll also maintain them for years to come.

THE NEXT STEP:

We offer free design consultations and free quotes. Please contact us to discuss your outdoor lighting needs and how we can be of assistance.

Let us tell you a little bit about our crew and how we came to be. 
RTA Landscape and pools started as a side hobby 30+ years ago. The owner, Rei, worked for the largest construction company in Canada since he was 17 and fell in love with the industry immediately. He worked for other large family run companies and dabbled in different areas of construction. However, with a drive for success, extreme work ethic, and precision he chased after a second dream on the side. Rei found a love for landscape and began his journey that has now led him to where he is today; running the most TRUSTED landscape and pool company serving York Region & The GTA.
