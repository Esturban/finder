​

G&H Cabinetry and Woodworks is a family-owned custom cabinetry company located in Cambridge ON, our shop is equipped with state-of-the-art machinery that allows us to build the highest quality custom kitchens serving Waterloo Region and GTA.

 

We know how important a kitchen in a home is:

​

No matter what type of home you live in, no matter how large or small, you will likely agree that no home is complete without a kitchen. From kitchens with small stoves to open-concept areas with sprawling islands and countertops, there are many ways to envision this important and efficient room in the home.

​

The way you use your kitchen can make a statement about your lifestyle. Decades ago, kitchens were often much smaller and only contained necessary cooking areas. Instead of it being a utilitarian room, it was utilized simply for preparing the meals and was often separated from the dining rooms to conceal the mess and smell left behind.

In more modern homes, kitchens are often larger and serve multiple purposes. For example, many homeowners have comfortable seating areas in their kitchens, as well as storage cabinets and even nooks or spaces for work units. You can now use your kitchen in a variety of ways that work best for you, and it is here to enhance your lifestyle, rather than become an obstacle to it.

​

Kitchens are Family Gathering Spaces:

​

The kitchen was not always the main hub of the home, but now it is becoming more and more that way. The kitchen is the most likely area for families to congregate, for people to discuss the details of their days with each other, and for guests and friends to spend time and hang out with their loved ones.

Most kitchens are equipped with enough room to fit multiple people since it’s a much more popular space to spend time. Amenities like bar seating arrangements and a larger area of flat working spaces with stone or quartz countertops can provide multiple functions, inviting people to sit, stay, chat, do their work, and catch up on all the local news.

 

Kitchens are Evolving Spaces:

​

kitchens are dynamic spaces that continue to grow and evolve to change with the needs and lifestyles of the modern homeowner. A space that was once an afterthought for food preparation is now the main gathering hall for many families and friends.

​

Not only is the kitchen vitally important because it contains the appliances and tools necessary to prepare any kind of meal, but it is also one of the most important spaces for storage, seating, and communication, Without the kitchen, the home would likely feel empty and confused, without a direction.

​

The smallest details can make a real impact when it comes to designing a kitchen space, but only a true professional knows how to bring these details together to create a seamless design, That is where we can use our knowledge and years of experience to get the most use out of your kitchen space functionality.

 

Show Your Kitchen Some Appreciation Today:

​

You should be able to love the space you are in, and you should be able to modify it to suit the needs of your lifestyle; it is, after all, the most important room in the home!

​

Quality:

​

We are committed to using only the highest quality materials on the market to provide our clients with high-quality kitchens and long-lasting products, using only ¾” material to build our cabinet boxes in a blind dado construction method gives the cabinets the durability that an everyday use environment needs.

​

Drawer boxes:

​

All of our drawer boxes are made with ¾” thick maple plywood in a blind dado construction method including the bottom of the drawer there are no screws or nails shown on the side of the drawers, and supported with Blum movento slides that are rated for 88 lbs of load capacity.

 

Door hinges:

​

All our hinges are Blum soft close hinges to give your kitchen cabinet doors that soft feel.

 

Doors and drawer fronts:

​

Our shop has the capabilities in building our kitchen cabinet doors and drawer fronts bringing this in-house gave us full control over our projects and the ability to always meet our deadlines, we use the highest grade double refined MDF sheets (plum creek) to build our cabinet doors and drawer fronts.

​

Finish:

​

finishing is the most exciting step of every project it is the final touch up of the created art that’s why G&H Cabinetry invested in building our finishing line to even have more ability over our quality control, we only use high-quality industrial wood coatings to finish our cabinetry using a high-end sprayer that each of your finished parts will be spray-painted in professional spray booths.

​
