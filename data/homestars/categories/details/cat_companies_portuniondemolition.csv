While clients were satisfied with the final product, they often had to sacrifice the dream they originally had. Sometimes, the clients would be told that the changes they wanted would cost a lot more extra than was needed.

One day, we realised that if we could work directly with the clients, that they would be able to tell us directly what they want to see, and we would be more flexible to provide it for them.

Asbestos & Lead Removal: 
Asbestos is a natural mineral which was commonly used in homes, buildings and school for various uses such as insulation, ceiling tiles, plaster, vinyl floor tiles, roof patching, etc.
Today, asbestos is no longer used as extensively since prolonged exposure to it has proved to be hazardous to ones health. When the asbestos fibers are released into the air anyone breathing the air is at risk. Asbestos exposure has been linked to lung scaring and cancer. 
If you are unsure if products in your home or office contain asbestos you should have an Asbestos Certified Inspector inspect your home. If the product is protected and fibers are intact you can leave it as is. If the product has deteriorated it is essential to remove the asbestos from the premises.",toronto-asbestos-removal,2016-02-03T22:31:08.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,NA,1945772,Toronto Asbestos Removal,0,0,0,NA,"Demolition, demolition, excavation, salvage, city demolition, demolition city, demolition company, demolition companies, demolition co, demolition inc, demolition business, concrete removal, demolition of building, building demolition, demolition building, demolition contractors, demolition of house, demolition house, house demolition, house for demolition, demolition removal, demolition and removal, demolition home, home demolition, demolish house, how to demolish a house, demo companies, demolition and construction, demolition construction, construction and demolition, construction demolition, demolition contractor, demolition tools, cost of demolition, demolition cost, demolishing a house, demolition concrete, demolition of concrete, concrete demolition, ,",0,NA,NA,FALSE,0,0,0,0,FALSE,9f478464b20eeb4eca2e0f9610c4d3001ba87327,FALSE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,2080977,-1.0,339,NA,NA
