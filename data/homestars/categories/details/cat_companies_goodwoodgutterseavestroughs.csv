*****

Cleaning your eaves is one of the most important things you can do to maintain the beauty and value of your home. When eavestroughs are full of leaves and debris they become heavy and get pulled off pitch. This can result in damage to the fascia and soffit areas. As water overflows it leaks behind the eaves and can travel into your home damaging walls and timber.

*****

Eaves cleaning and repair plays a vital role in the maintenance and protection of your home. They are part of the rainwater drainage system that helps prevent:

*****

Foundation Damage
Soffit and Fascia Rot
Spalling Brickwork
Internal Damp and Mold Growth
Termite, Mosquito and Rodent Infestations
Landscape Destruction

Any of these problems can be costly and time consuming to fix. Consistent maintenance is critical to keep your home dry. Let our Toronto eavestrough cleaning professionals give you peace of mind when dealing with your eaves or roof problems.

Trades by Jack is proud to offer this fantastic product to help you. Avoid the messy work involved in dealing with your gutters and eavestroughs.

Say goodbye to the dangerous and unpleasant job of climbing up to your roof to clean out your gutters once and for all, without the expense of paying someone else to do it.

Gutters capture the rainwater from your roof and carry it safely to the ground, away from your foundation, where it can cause serious damage. Ordinary gutters capture leaves, twigs and other organic debris that causes them to clog and overflow during rainstorms.

 •LeafGuard’s patented design causes rainwater to flow around its curved hood and into the gutter, keeping leaves and debris out.
 •LeafGuard Brand Gutters are guaranteed not to clog for as long as you own your home, or Gutter Depot will clean your gutters for free.
 •LeafGuard Gutters are made to fit any home in a variety of colours. Best of all they are made out durable materials, designed to last as long as you have a roof.

Our roof refurbishment process

The customer selects ‘Shingle’ which refers to the “Asphalt shingle”. Most of our roofs are used in this process. Previously mainly used a triple old fashioned tile. What is the latest process using an Architectural for 30 years? First of all, to remove the previous tile on the roof, you discovered that Shingle is just the “skin” of the roof, and there is a layer of Underlayment below it. “paper”. It is mainly used for waterproofing. Like Shingle, the paper and Shingle are already firmly glued together. In addition, there are chimneys and vents on the roof. There are waterproof boards under them. The name Flashing is linked to Paper and Shingle. Therefore, it is also necessary to “eradicate” together. After shovelling it off, the bone on the roof is left. It is a deck. The wooden boards on the roof are also divided into solid wood and plywood. If any rotten boards are found and there are holes in the boards, they must be replaced or replaced first. Then go in the opposite direction and begin to spread new paper on the board. In order not to let the rain drop down the eaves, we will install a drip rim “Drip Eidge” along the eaves. Then start Shingle from the bottom of the eaves. From bottom to top, from the right to the left, a piece of cloth, this is a repetitive work, meet the vents, to replace the flashing. Finally, the completion of the Ridge cap was nearly completed. Also note that in addition to paving tiles neatly, the main job is nailing, which is to hit the nails. The nails are good enough to play T deep and play tight. The most prone to problems are the protruding roofs, double inspections of the exhausts and chimneys, the cleaning of roof tile sinks after the replacement of roof parts, and the ground cleaning. Completing the photo shoot of the roof after the completion of the old and new contrast and key waterproof pictures send text messages to the owners to stay at the end of ten years of maintenance.

What refurbishment roof package?

What are the advantages compared to ‘traditional roof renovation’?

The owners and practitioners who have experienced renovation of the roof know that the roof is a very complicated, high-risk system project. During the construction process, some consumers can avoid non-direct revenue costs.
