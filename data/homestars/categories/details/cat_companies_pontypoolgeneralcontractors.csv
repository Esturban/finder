Properly installed fencing creates safety for your children, safety for your pets.  Properly installed decking creates beautiful and functional outdoor living space for you to enjoy with family and friends.  Why work with Ajax Fence Ltd?

We offer quality work at a fair price.

A fence is an investment in your home’s value, so you want it to stand the test of time. We can provide references from customers we've worked with over the past 40 years. We build to last. Our workmanship is excellent, so you’re never left chasing after a company for repairs.  We never overinflate our prices – we have been building fences right for over 40 years, at a fair price.

We hire only experienced full time staff.

At Ajax Fence our staff are fully experienced... some have been building fences right for close to 40 years! Employing only experienced fence builders ensures every fence is built to our exacting standards – and will last.

We only use quality materials, and do not skimp.

While some companies may offer lower prices, our jobs are priced fairly while providing proper construction using quality materials. A fence board can be installed using only one nail, or it can be done correctly to ensure it lasts.

We have history and connection.

Mark Pierson started Ajax Fence and oversees every quote, every job site and is often hands on.  We're excited that the next generation, Derek Pierson, is now taking an active role in the operation of the company.  You know who you’re working with, who is in charge of the job, and you know it will be installed correctly.

As there is no governing body for fence building – be clear of the details on any quotes you receive.  Is the installer experienced?  Does the company qualify for a current WSIB clearance certificate?  Does the company carry adequate commercial liability insurance?  Are future repair costs going to outweigh your initial savings on a lower quality of workmanship and product?
