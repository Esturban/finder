I have been running my own business in Toronto since 1989. I started working with masonry at a very young age with my father - pouring footings and foundations, brickwork, etc. My wife and I have been working together on the job for over 10 years. She's an amazing masonry technician who really pays attention to detail as do I.
     I provide mortar color and brick matching services. I am also very skilled in stonework and enjoy building and restoring stone and brick structures such as porches, walkways and pillars, etc. My parging work is excellent as well. 
     Our services include: Tuckpointing, Masonry & Bricklaying, Pointing of brickwork, Brick replacement, Porch - Repair/Rebuild, Parging, Stone Work - Walkways, Walls etc, Foundation Repair, Concrete Sidewalks. 

I look forward to working with you!

Q.What is the minimum/maximum amount a chimney flue should protrude above the chimney cap? 
A.You may be surprised to find that the minimum amount is 2""or 50mm and the maximum amount  4"" or 100mm.(bare this in mind when getting a rebuild. only true professionals adhere to code)
 
Q.Why do old buildings seem to be out lasting newer one's?
A. There are a few factors involved, the main one is money (people are in such a rush to finish a project that their quality slips) but a big aspect is methodologies which are used, or not in a lot of cases! History has already shown us the way to successfully build so we should only be getting better!
