That's how it starts for most companies. That's how it started for Mattamy Homes in 1978.


Mattamy Homes is rigorous about every single aspect of community planning. We acquire the land, design the homes, plan the streets, and we create the people spaces—the walking and biking trails, parks, and other community features. 

Still, our process remains unchanged in one fundamental way. We continue to keep our eyes, ears, and minds open. We talk to our future and present homeowners to completely understand diverse and evolving styles of living. And we continually attempt to provide for you the best, most liveable spaces with everything we learn.



Mattamy Homes is the largest privately owned homebuilder in North America, with a nearly 40-year history of operations across the United States and Canada. Every year, Mattamy helps 7,000 families realize their dream of home ownership. In the United States, the company is represented in 10 markets – Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Phoenix, Tucson, Jacksonville, Orlando (where its US head office is located), Tampa, Sarasota, Naples and Southeast Florida – and in Canada, those communities stretch across the Greater Toronto Area, as well as in Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton.

Renovations and Design are a perfect solution if you’re committed to staying in your home but are frustrated with certain elements that require change
Home additions can be the best way to get the most out of your current home while staying in the neighborhood you love. Maybe your family has decided it’s time to remodel the kitchen, Rooms, Bathroom, Back yard and Deck or maybe they are growing and requires additional living space. Whatever the ultimate goal, renovating your current home to suit your needs is far easier and more cost efficient than moving. Home renovation projects are complicated. From defining requirements and identifying the scope of work, to establishing a realistic investment range, navigating through the building permit process, and designing and selecting finishes that bring everything together — it can all be very challenging.
Our team is equipped with brilliant designers; construction experts; skilled, licensed contractors; and create stunning, functional spaces built to the highest standards.
