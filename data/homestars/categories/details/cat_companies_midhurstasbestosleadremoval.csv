Asbestos & Lead Removal:
Asbestos is a natural mineral which was commonly used in homes, buildings and school for various uses such as insulation, ceiling tiles, plaster, vinyl floor tiles, roof patching, etc.

Today, asbestos is no longer used as extensively since prolonged exposure to it has proved to be hazardous to ones health. When the asbestos fibers are released into the air anyone breathing the air is at risk. Asbestos exposure has been linked to lung scaring and cancer.
If you are unsure if products in your home or office contain asbestos you should have an Asbestos Certified Inspector inspect your home. If the product is protected and fibers are intact you can leave it as is. If the product has deteriorated it is essential to remove the asbestos from the premises.",ontario-asbestos-removal,2011-07-12T06:39:17.000-04:00,NA,"We Serve many areas ---------------------------- North York, Thornhill, Vaughan, Richmond Hill Newmarket, Oakville, Orangeville, Ottawa, Pickering, Port Credit, Paris Scarborough, ...",,,"Asbestos removal, disposal, encapsulation and enclosure.
