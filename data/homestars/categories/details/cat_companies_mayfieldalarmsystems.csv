By strategically locating devices designed to detect intrusion, Safetech's acquired a unique ability to successfully protect both people and property. By blending together different security technologies and procedures we achieve the highest security standard possible with the lowest “rate of loss” among our clients in the industry.
 
Only by taking a comprehensive integrated security approach to the needs of our clients can the best results be achieved. For instance, statistically adding an alarm will reduce a chance of a ‘break and enter’ by 10x when compared with a home that has no alarm system. However, if you combine one or more surveillance tools together, such as an alarm system combined with video surveillance cameras, your chance of a ‘break and enter’ is reduced by 40x when compared with an unprotected property.
 
Furthermore, even if you do end up being a victim of a ‘break and enter’ the amount of property stolen is 50% less than it would be if the premise only had an alarm system. Compare this to a property that has little or no protection (no alarm or video cameras) the savings are even greater, with a total 80% reduction in loss of property value. Therefore, security surveillance tools work even better when used in tandem to prevent property loss and are a very effective way of deterring and reducing crime.
 
Good Protection Starts with Good Design
 
Safetech loss prevention advisors are trained to ensure clients receive proper security coverage using the significant arsenal of security tools and techniques they have at their disposal.
 
An advisor will begin first by having a detailed discussion with our potential clients to determine their specific application and security needs. Once an advisor is satisfied that they have an understanding of the clients needs a security solution will be recommended. There is absolutely ‘no obligation’ to follow any recommendation given and there is no charge for our security evaluation.
 
Good protection may start with good design but it can only be maintained with good monitoring and management procedures.Most people think that a 24 hour monitoring station exists solely to respond to emergency signals. However, equally important is the need to respond to no signals when one is expected, or to trouble signals coming from the control panel.
 
A trouble condition may arise when a client’s alarm panel fails to send its scheduled weekly test signal to the monitoring station, or, if it sends a signal indicating that the power has failed or the back up battery is low. “How quickly a security company deciphers and responds to these conditions is a true measure of the quality of their service”.

The following is a VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
 
DISCLAIMER
BY PUBLISHING THIS PUBLIC MESSAGE  EXPECTS 
NO OBLIGATION TO BUY FROM TOTAL SECURITY CO
THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
NOT MEANT TO DISCREDIT ANY COMPANY 
 
Several alarm companies only have SUMMER PROGRAMS? They rent houses and hire large crews of university students which are offered large commissions ($400 to $500 per contract)to get you to sign up.
 
LEARN MORE by Googling ""door to door alarm scam"".
 
The PRESSURE:
Sales person won't leave even when you tell them to ""Leave""
Sales person won't leave when you tell them ""No Thanks""
Sales person won't leave when you say ""I Already Have Your Products or Service""
Sales person name drops the name of your neighbor and makes it sound like ""they signed up"" or ""they bought one"" or ""they referred me to you""
Sales person comes to the house several times and won't leave you alone
Sales person offers cheap cameras /chances to win vacations/free groceries for a year .....anything to ENTICE YOU TO SIGN THE CONTRACT
Once the system is INSTALLED you will be LIABLE for the FULL AND COMPLETE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ( typically 3 years or more)
EARLY TO TERMINATION OF CONTRACT IS LEGALLY REFERRED TO "" breach of contract"" and customer is more than likely to pay early CANCELLATION CHARGES amounting to over $700 + THE FULL VALUE OF THE CONTRACT 
Failure to. pay could result in collections , small claims and NEGATIVE REPORTING to the Credit Bureau 
 
The SOLUTIONS:
Put Up Your Hand and ""Say NO"".
Immediately close the door and the sales person will eventually leave.
Tell them ""You are Trespassing"" and that you are calling the BBB Better Business Bureau, Consumer Protection Branch and the Police if they do not leave.
BBB 1-888-352-7601, Consumer Protection (Local office)
Always Get 3 Quotes for whatever you consider purchasing. This gives you the time to gather information and to check if the ""deal"" being presented to you is the best option.
Look up reviews posted on social media such as HOMESTARS TWITTER FACEBOOK ETC.
Never Accept Quick Delivery of a product or service. This gives you a cooling off period and more time to gather facts.
If you did proceed with the offer You Have 10 Days to Change Your Mind and CANCEL (and get a full refund). It's the Law in Ontario (Consumers Protection Act)
Create Awareness and Share on Social Media as referred above.
Contact the local media
