<p>Since 1992, Trico Homes has built new single and multi-family homes, offering a diverse selection of starter, move-up and semi-estate homes in Calgary, Airdrie, Chestermere, Cochrane, DeWinton and Okotoks. Whether you're looking for a quick possession or something more personalized, Trico’s team of dedicated staff will ensure you’ll find the perfect house to call home. </p>

<p>At Trico, we start every single day with one goal in mind; to deliver incredible life-changing moments. We know Calgarians have choices when buying a home. That’s why we’ve built a company that builds so much more than quality houses.</p>

<p>In the many years since Trico built our first home, our city has grown and so has our love for it. Along the way, we’ve become one of Calgary’s top builders - building over 11,500 single and multi-family homes and earning a reputation for our design, craftsmanship and customer care. Trico has received numerous accolades, including a Platinum member status as one of Canada’s 50 Best Managed Companies, Canada’s Best Workplaces, Canada's Top Small & Medium Employers, and a CHBA Excellence in Housing award. We are also proud to be Western Canada’s first and only homebuilder to become a certified B Corporation.</p>

<p>We’re committed to our industry and our city. We want to make our mark. To become a legacy company. We do more than develop quality homes. We help develop the place we call home.</p>
