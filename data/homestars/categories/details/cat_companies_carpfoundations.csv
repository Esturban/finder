A large percentage of our work comes to us through word-of-mouth referrals from past clients.  We value that trust and work very hard to ensure that we exceed your expectations. 

With more than 30,000 (and counting), dry basements and happy customers, we continue to grow our company, one satisfied customer at a time - putting service first - it's been that way since 1979. 

We offer what other companies simply cannot
   	
* We have worked in every community in the Ottawa-Carleton area and have a thorough knowledge of the environmental/soil conditions where you live.

* We have waterproofed and/or repaired tens of thousands of residential and commercial foundations and can offer you interior and exterior solutions.  No company in the Ottawa-Carleton area has seen and solved as many wet basement problems as we have.

* Collective experience of management and staff results in unsurpassed quality of services.

* Affordable, competitive pricing as a result of our many years of experience and superior purchasing power.

* Innovative products and applications as a result of our commitment to excellence and attention to detail.

* We won't recommend an expensive weeping tile or pier solution if all you need is a foundation crack repair, nor will we offer you a bandage solution at a low-ball price, leaving you with a problem that will recur a few months later.  We will diagnose the problem accurately and offer solutions that will save you money in the short and long run.

* We stand behind our work with written, transferable guarantees.

We operate from our own 16,000 square foot building and offer a full range of affordable, professional, all season services.  We are experts in systems involving foundation repairs, underpinning, foundation wall replacement, interior drainage, concrete and masonry restoration.
