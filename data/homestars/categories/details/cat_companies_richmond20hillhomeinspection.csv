As your Home and Mold Inspector,  Ambicorp Property Inspections look beyond the aesthetic attributes of a home and inspect for defects or deficiencies that may lead to costly repairs in the future.  I conduct a full inspection of the property's interior and exterior.  There is no pass or fail on a home inspection, rather a thorough report of any defects observed, indicating the condition of the home and the resulting recommendations to the client.  As my client, you will have the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on your biggest purchase and investment and the place that you will call home.

    Lab Results Obtained the Next Day - A detailed lab report is provided the next day for Mold Inspections.  In addition to taking mold samples for laboratory analysis, we also do Indoor Air Quality Testing to check for the presence of mold spores in the air.

The lab report details the species of mold, the spore concentration and any known health problems or allergic reactions that may be associated with the mold.   Some people have allergies to pets such as dogs and cats, while others have allergies or concerns about cockroaches, rats, mice and dust mites.  Did you know we also test the air for allergens?  Contact us​ for more details.

Proudly serving clients in the GTA and surrounding areas. 
DSM Property Services is proud to provide our clients with professional, reliable inspection services. All our inspections are conducted by a qualified and fully accredited Registered Home Inspector (RHI) and Certified Thermographer with over 25 years experience in construction and renovation. Our inspection services include:
•	Detailed Inspection of all visible structures and components of a home,
•	Infrared thermal scans* of non-visible structures and components to detect potential issues with moisture, electrical, and insulation  
•	Use of the latest Inspection Technology
•	Repair and cost estimates
•	Recommendations and Maintenance planning
•	A fully detailed and easy to read report of all findings including pictures for quick reference
•	A reference library and links to more detailed information on the components of the home
You also have the option to purchase a detailed Home History Report.
 *Infrared Thermal Scans are part of our premium package and are conducted to detect what the naked eye cannot. This process can identify potential problems in structure, electrical components, insulation, air leakage and moisture content.
An Infrared Scan can:
•	help locate potential safety issues with live electrical equipment, 
•	detect hidden heating and cooling losses, 
•	detect moisture intrusion which could cause mould, 
•	detect inadequate or non-existent insulation, 
•	detect plumbing leaks and poor construction.
•	It could save you in potential repair costs!!
Book a thermal scan inspection:
* Before a warranty inspection
* Before a Real Estate Investment
* Before a contractor begins work
* After a completed project
* As part of a routine maintenance check on your home.

Doing your homework on finding the right Home Inspector is crucial. You need to make sure you are hiring a qualified and experienced Inspector. After all, this person will be providing you with the information you need to make an informed decision about some very costly investments, whether it be the purchase or selling of a home, a new home renovation or existing repair, maintenance of your existing home or potential issues you are having.
We hope that DSM Property Services Inc. can help you with your inspection needs!

Dive Deep Home Inspections only works with Certified Home Inspectors who have past residential construction or renovation experience. We know homes from the ground up. A proper home inspection, sometimes called a Field Performance Review, consists of a visual inspection and tests using the standard operating controls, of the major systems in your home. Systems which include roofing, structure, exterior, interior and insulation, plumbing, electrical, and of course your heating and air conditioning. Don't trust such a detailed inspection to just anyone. Our certified and experienced inspectors know how these systems should function. All inspections are documented in a report, that includes full colour pictures, and diagrams and links that help you to understand your inspectors findings. Your report comes to you by email within 24 hours and you will have access to your inspectors for as long as you need for questions and/or explanations. Let us Dive Deep into your home!
