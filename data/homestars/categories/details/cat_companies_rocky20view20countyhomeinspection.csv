When you are buying a house you are buying a job. Invest in a Diamond Home Inspection and make an informed choice when buying your new home. 
I am committed to providing the best inspection experience for my clients. I am responsible for giving you an understanding of the scope of the work that you are looking at buying. Some of that depends on how it was built, some of that depends on how well it was maintained/renovated. I perform a visual, non-invasive inspection of the condition of the home, so you can make an informed purchasing decision. Using my training, tools and experience to read the story of how the home was built and how it was maintained. Every house will have ""issues"", doesn't matter if it is a ""new"" house or a ""used"" house. The question then becomes - so what? Is this a major problem now? Is it something that will only get worse or is it something that is no longer changing? Is it is a big deal or red herring? Some of the answers will depend on you, your patience, ability, monetary situation and/or your plans for the home, others- like safety issues, are self explanatory.
I have a background in construction, internationally recognized training, national inspector association affiliations expert tools and a thirst for continued education.

May is Deck Safety Month. Be sure to get a deck inspection before the summer entertainment season!

Getting you shingles replaced and want to be sure it was done right? Include an inspection as part of the contract, and Call for a roof inspection before you make final payment.
