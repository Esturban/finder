Our innovative approach to basement post removal has been designed and approved by qualified engineers with many satisfied customers. The method does not require any welding or major beam replacements. We have also made it possible through our ingenuity to be able to sink beams into the joists to have a perfectly flat ceiling finish on both the first and/or second floors of your home.
