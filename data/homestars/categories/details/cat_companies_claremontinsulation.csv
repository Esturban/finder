For more than a decade, Celluloseman Inc. has been a frontrunner in southwestern Ontario’s residential insulation industry. We specialize in insulation extraction and insulation installation, making homes safer, more comfortable, and more affordable to live in. Our highly experienced and licensed technicians will gladly walk you through the process and recommend ways to make your home more energy efficient, as well as address concerns like mold remediation, (vermiculite removal) asbestos abatement, air sealing, draft and soundproofing.

Celluloseman’s expertise and reliability have made us a sought-after insulation contractor in the GTA. We assisted with the insulation removal from hundreds of homes damaged by the catastrophic Sunrise Propane explosion in 2008, and participated in the cleanup effort after a tornado ripped through more than 600 homes in the city of Vaughan in 2011. In 2019, Celluloseman was featured in HGTV's Property Brothers: Forever Home in Season 2.
