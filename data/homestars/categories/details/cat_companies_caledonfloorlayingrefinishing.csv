After growing up in a family owned Floor Refinishing business and seeing the pros and cons I wanted to do business differently, better. Because I became aware that as a home owner it can be a challenge to understand everything about the project you’re hiring for and to make the best decision for your needs.



I know as a home owner looking at a floor refinishing project you have concerns about the quality of the job, the time frame as well as the longevity of the finish so you can enjoy the beauty of one of the greatest assets of your home for years.


At NewRidge Refinishing we’ve learned and operate with the understanding that it’s not only how we start a project that’s important to you it’s also how we finish it.



NewRidge Refinishing is comprised of the best contractors in the industry that take pride in their trade, from the quality of machinery to the professional processes and the high standard for materials that are designed to give your floors a lasting finish.



We worry about all the details of preparation, protecting the area outside of the project, cleaning and completing so you can rest knowing that your job will be done as expected and on time.



We work with your general contractor if needed as well have recommendations should you need them to accommodate all of your project needs.



It’s great knowing what to expect and when to expect it when you choose NewRidge refinishing for your floor and stair refinishing needs.

Our core business is fine woodworking. We custom manufacture all elements related to the staircase industry. We make posts, treads (steps), balustrades (spindles or pickets), handrails as well as entire staircases made only from red oak. Combining the custom manufacturing facility along with skilled installation crews allow us to renovate your staircase in approximately 3-5 days. Visit our website www.idealstairs.ca to view our Testimonials, and listen to very satisfied clients who have generously allowed us to record their successful renovation in their own words.
 

[.::FLOORING - HARDWOOD AND LAMINATE::.]
Staircase renovation is not our only product. We believe we are the only staircase manufacturer that will renovate your staircase AND install hardwood flooring. We want to minimize the time and disruption in your home by coordinating these two products. We are dealers for many brands of hardwood and laminate flooring but our proudest boast is we have hardwood flooring that is 25% and 100% Canadian content. We offer custom colours on your hardwood flooring (over 750 square feet) for Red Oak and Maple. We value our premium service by supplying and ensuring the colour you choose for your flooring is also used on the renovated staircase.
 

[.::SANDING AND STAINING::.]
If you already have a solid oak staircase but you want it changed to a different colour, we also provide sanding and re-staining services. We can transform your builder staircase into a dream staircase easily within your budget. While you are considering changing the colour of your staircase, this is an excellent time to change the appearance. Since we will be taking off the handrail, pickets and posts to sand and stain your steps, take the opportunity to install another post style, such as square, remodel your existing pickets and changing the look from old to new. For the record ","Ideal Stairs offer excellent and professional service in new stair construction, sanding, custom staining and renovating your existing hardwood staircase (oak or maple) right in your home. If you currently have carpeted stairs, we can help transform your staircase to solid oak treads. 

We can change your posts, add new pickets and match the material to an existing colour in your house. Within 3 days, your central foyer is transformed from great to amazing.

Our service is not only limited to stairs. We can also sand and offer custom staining and refinishing of hardwood flooring.

Flooring installation including oak and maple hardwood, laminate and engineered.
