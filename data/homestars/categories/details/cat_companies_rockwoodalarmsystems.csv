The following is a VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
 
DISCLAIMER
BY PUBLISHING THIS PUBLIC MESSAGE  EXPECTS 
NO OBLIGATION TO BUY FROM TOTAL SECURITY CO
THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE MESSAGE
NOT MEANT TO DISCREDIT ANY COMPANY 
 
Several alarm companies only have SUMMER PROGRAMS? They rent houses and hire large crews of university students which are offered large commissions ($400 to $500 per contract)to get you to sign up.
 
LEARN MORE by Googling ""door to door alarm scam"".
 
The PRESSURE:
Sales person won't leave even when you tell them to ""Leave""
Sales person won't leave when you tell them ""No Thanks""
Sales person won't leave when you say ""I Already Have Your Products or Service""
Sales person name drops the name of your neighbor and makes it sound like ""they signed up"" or ""they bought one"" or ""they referred me to you""
Sales person comes to the house several times and won't leave you alone
Sales person offers cheap cameras /chances to win vacations/free groceries for a year .....anything to ENTICE YOU TO SIGN THE CONTRACT
Once the system is INSTALLED you will be LIABLE for the FULL AND COMPLETE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ( typically 3 years or more)
EARLY TO TERMINATION OF CONTRACT IS LEGALLY REFERRED TO "" breach of contract"" and customer is more than likely to pay early CANCELLATION CHARGES amounting to over $700 + THE FULL VALUE OF THE CONTRACT 
Failure to. pay could result in collections , small claims and NEGATIVE REPORTING to the Credit Bureau 
 
The SOLUTIONS:
Put Up Your Hand and ""Say NO"".
Immediately close the door and the sales person will eventually leave.
Tell them ""You are Trespassing"" and that you are calling the BBB Better Business Bureau, Consumer Protection Branch and the Police if they do not leave.
BBB 1-888-352-7601, Consumer Protection (Local office)
Always Get 3 Quotes for whatever you consider purchasing. This gives you the time to gather information and to check if the ""deal"" being presented to you is the best option.
Look up reviews posted on social media such as HOMESTARS TWITTER FACEBOOK ETC.
Never Accept Quick Delivery of a product or service. This gives you a cooling off period and more time to gather facts.
If you did proceed with the offer You Have 10 Days to Change Your Mind and CANCEL (and get a full refund). It's the Law in Ontario (Consumers Protection Act)
Create Awareness and Share on Social Media as referred above.
Contact the local media

Protect Your Home and Family
Keep an eye on what’s happening in and around your home in real-time, no matter where you are, with Indoor and Outdoor security cameras. You can also view recorded videos as well. 

Smart locks let you lock and unlock your door right from your smartphone. So whether you are leaving the house, or just climbing into bed, you never have to wonder if you forgot to lock the door.

Answer your door even if you’re not home, with a Wi-Fi doorbell camera. You can see and speak with whoever is at the door, even if you are at work or on vacation. 

You can get help when you need it - with 24/7 professional monitoring, you’ll get notifications if unexpected events occur, and our security experts are ready to send emergency services if needed.

Control Your Home with Your Voice or Smartphone
From your smartphone, you can use Amazon Alexa (with TELUS Home Assistant) or Siri to turn on your lights, warm up or cool down your home, arm your SmartHome security system, open or close your garage door, and so much more. 



Save Money on Insurance
According to The Electronic Security Association website alarm.org,  you can save up to 20% on home insurance with a professionally installed 24/7 home monitoring system. 

You can also save up to 6% on your heating bill with smart home automation devices - like a smart thermostat. Better for your wallet and mother nature.


Flexible Installation Options
You can do it yourself - self-install your system on your own time with our online guidance. Or we can do it for you - our professional technicians will safely install your order.
