Company Background:
 
Please give a description of your company and the products/services you offer:

Pesterminate Inc. provides pest control services to the GTA, to both residences and businesses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, such as proper inspections, and using the least toxic chemicals possible, are used to ensure the safety of all our clients while still effectively killing all the pests. For many pests, such as raccoons, rodents and wasps, chemicals are not used at all. 

Tell us about your background of your business and yourself.

I did a course on extermination at Guelph University, and went on to obtain an Exterminator's license from the Ministry of Environment. I have spent 9 years in this industry, learning about it, and learning about business, by originally starting at a large, well known, Canadian  pest control company. I use the knowledge and the skills I have acquired to keep my clients protected, as well as dealing with the pests issues quickly and effectively. Customer satisfaction is my top priority.
 
What inspired you to pursue your profession?

Many people have pest problems they suffer through on a daily basis. Working as an exterminator allows for me to help these people, and to make their lives better as well. Reading reviews written by people who are 100% satisfied with my services makes me extremely happy, as these people are now happy. 

Where do you see yourself in the near future?
I plan on providing services to more people in the future, both residential and commercial, as well as expand my business and train a few people to the extermination services. I also aim to educate people on pests and how to prevent them from infesting their homes or business' as customer satisfaction will remain my number one priority.
