Specializing in the fields of protection, restoration as well as maintenance. Each project has individual needs and The Marble Clinics team of experts work to produce top quality results.

<strong>We offer the following services:</strong>

<strong>Marble Cleaning:</strong> Remove dirt and dust stuck in the stone surface or in the grout lines – this will not remove scratches or etching alone.

<strong>Wax Stripping:</strong> The use of wax and topical coatings can damage natural stone over time, and causes yellowing after short periods of heavy traffic; The Marble Clinic can remove topical coatings from any natural stone to prepare it for proper restoration and sealing techniques.

<strong>Stone Grinding:</strong> This is the most common restoration technique and will remove deep scratches, lippage, etching, white stun marks and yellowing. It is also used to remove epoxy from chip and crack repairs.

<strong>Marble Polishing:</strong> Through mechanical polishing methods, natural stone acquires a high lustre and reflects natural light – it therefore does not need topical coatings or wax to achieve a desired shine.

<strong>Marble Honing:</strong> Will remove minor etching on low lustre stone surfaces, and give the surface a clean uniform finish without the polished look.

<strong>Finish Alteration:</strong> The Marble Clinic can change the appearance of a natural stones finish; from honed to polished, polished to honed, and everything in-between.

<strong>Countertop Seam-Polishing:</strong> Visible counter top seams can be filled with epoxy based resins, ground and polished or honed to match the stone colour and virtually disappear.

<strong>Chip and Crack Repair:</strong> Chips and cracks in any natural stone can be filled with coloured epoxy resin and refinished to match the surrounding material.

<strong>Grout Cleaning and Sealing:</strong> Over time grout accumulates dirt and becomes quite dirty. Grout can be cleaned and sealed to improve the floors beauty and facilitate easier maintenance cleaning.

<strong>Grout Colouring:</strong> An easy way to change the look and feel of a tile floor.

<strong>Stone Sealing:</strong> All natural stone should be professionally cleaned and sealed to increase the longevity of the material and repel dark staining solutions.

<strong>Colour Enhancing:</strong> Using enhancing impregnators on flamed or textured material is an excellent way to protect your stone and bring it back to life.

<strong>Table Repair:</strong> Our expert technicians can repair most tables, mantals, fireplace’s, statues or fountains – so long as it is a relatively clean break.

<strong>Stone Maintenance:</strong> Specially formulated compounds used on an annual or semi-annual basis keep any surface in high traffic areas looking good year round.",the-marble-clinic,2006-05-09T20:00:00.000-04:00,NA,"Toronto, Mississauga, Newmarket, North York, Oakville, Richmond Hill, Scarborough, Thornhill, Unionville, Vaughan, Woodbridge, Waterloo, Cambridge, Kitchener, Brampton, Concord, Etobicoke, Markham",Mon-Fri 8-5,"Marble, Granite, Terrazzo, Limestone, Slate, Porcelain, Ceramic","Cleaning, Grinding, Polishing, Honing, Sealing, Maintenance, Restoration, Repair, Chipped or Broken Epoxy Repair","The Marble Clinic, GranQuartz, HMK","Natural Stone Protection, Restoration and Maintenance",1982,14,"Cash, Cheque, MasterCard, Visa",,,,TRUE,TRUE,,$500.00,TRUE,FALSE,,77804,The Marble Clinic,238,200,22,9.715,"Tile & Stone Contractors, Natural Stone Tile, Stone Floor Tile, Ceramic Tile, Floor tile, Tile installers, Stone installers, stone counter top installers, tile counter top installers, stone backsplash intallers, granite installers, marble installers, limestone installers, linoleum installers, slate contractors, slate installers,install tite ,backsplash , fire place veenerneed someone to install blacksplash , wall stone veener bath room mosaic,",0,2010-03-24T09:44:22.000-04:00,marbleclinic,FALSE,0,0,22,100,FALSE,5365f334884c20e2ab5d051476cfa22b8a2dd230,TRUE,2022-11-23T11:34:43.000-05:00,TRUE,TRUE,2228511,96.85708935,442,NA,NA

We provide comprehensive services consisting in laying floor and wall tiles, porcelain, ceramic and glass for the use of private persons, entrepreneurs and developers.

02.	Natural
Stone Installation.
Natural stone is an ideal decoration for those who appreciate classic beauty and references to nature in interior design. What’s more, it is a very universal material that will work both in interiors – e.g. as a kitchen or living room decoration, but also outside – as a facade or fence covering.

03.	Complete Bathroom
Renovation
Bathroom finishing is a very important and at the same time the basic element of any major renovation or interior finishing. The way in which we arrange our bathroom depends basically on only one factor, namely – the size of the bathroom. If you need to connect a hydraulic or other installation – we will also take care of that for you!
