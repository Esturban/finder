FAQ
My furnace won’t start, what should I do?

Check to make sure the furnace filter is clean.
Check the settings on your thermostat.
Check the battery of the thermostat.
Check to make sure power to the furnace is on.
Finally, make sure the gas supply to the furnace is open.
If the problem persists, you will need to contact an Ottawa Heating and Cooling technician
My AC won’t start, what should I do?

Check to make sure the furnace filter is clean.
Check the settings on your thermostat.
Check the battery of the thermostat.
Check to make sure power to the furnace is ON and out door disconnect is on.
Check the cover if it is an outdoor unit.
If the problem persists, you will need to contact an Ottawa Heating and Cooling technician
How do I know if I have an existing warranty on my furnace, air conditioner or HVAC system?

Locate the label on the exterior of the equipment for a manufacture date. Equipment less than five years old may have a warranty, but also may not depending on the make. Warranty terms and conditions vary by manufacturer and the installing company.

Why is my AC Freezing up?

There are many reasons that can cause your HVAC system to freeze up; most of them usually need to be corrected by a professional technician.
If you are experiencing this problem, you can make sure the air filter is clean or replaced and ensure that the the airflow is not restricted.  If this does not solve the problem, you should contact a qualifiedIf the problem persists, you will need to contact an Ottawa Heating and Cooling technician who will be able to diagnose the following issue:

Low refrigerant: In some cases, freezing up is caused by a leak in the refrigerant lines. Weak solder joints, friction from piping rubbing or vibrating against an object, leaking valves or loose fittings can cause leaks. The length of time your system has been installed and the type and location of the leak will determine whether to have the system repaired or replaced.
Dirty evaporator coil: Over time, the evaporator coil will become dirty. On these occasions, the results are similar to those of having a dirty filter. Progressively you will lose airflow, slowly enough that you probably would not realize it until it freezes up or is not cooling adequately.
Defective blower motor or relay: A blower motor running at an improper speed or not running at all can cause freezing. It can also be sporadic, starting at full speed and slowing down after it heats up. Or a relay could cause it to start one time and not the next.  
Why is it important to have regular maintenance on my home comfort system?

You probably wouldn’t get a brand-new car and plan to never have to put air in the tires, change the oil and check out any unfamiliar noises. Your home comfort system is like your car’s engine, it’s a mechanical device with a motor, electrical components… and even fuel. So it is important to have routine maintenance of your home comfort system by a qualified technician. If not maintained properly and routinely, even the best heating and air conditioning equipment could cause problems and become less ‘fuel’ efficient over time.

What are the Advantages of a Two Stage Furnace?

There are three advantages to having a two stage furnace: it saves energy, it heats your home more completely and it filters your air better.

How Does a Two-Stage Furnace Work?

A two-stage furnace works by using a different set of programming than a normal one-stage furnace.  Simply put, when it is only moderately cold inside, then the furnace’s control board opens the fuel control valve to the partially open position, and heats the house to the desired temperature before turning off.  If the house is cooling a lot quicker than normal, for instance on a miserably cold day in the dead of winter, then the control panel opens the valve to the full open position, where the furnace runs full blast to heat your home.

Terminology

What is an ENERGY STAR certified air conditioning system?

The ENERGY STAR rating lets you know that any product carrying this designation meets or exceeds a premium level of energy efficiency. ENERGY STAR in Canada is a voluntary arrangement between Natural Resources Canada’s Office of Energy Efficiency and organizations that manufacture sell or promote products that meet the ENERGY STAR levels of energy performance.

What’s an ECM Motor?

An ECM (Electronically Commutated Motor) is a brushless motor technology in forced air heating applications that works to reduce the electrical consumption of the furnace motor by as much as 60% (over a standard motor).

What is SEER in air condition?

Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio.  Higher the SEER ratings mean greater efficiency. As of January 2006, the federal government mandates that all new central air conditioning equipment be at least SEER-13, but there is equipment available rated as high as SEER-18 and even SEER-23 .3

Incentives and Rebates

How much rebate on new High Efficiency furnace will I receive?

You will receive:

$250 incentive when you replace your existing furnace with the purchase and installation of a new eligible high-efficiency furnace equipped with an Electronically Commutated Motor (ECM).
How much a rebate on new energy star central air condition will I receive?

You will receive:

$250 incentive when you purchase and install a new ENERGY STAR certified central air conditioning (CAC) system that satisfies at least a 14.5 SEER and 12 EER.
$400 incentive when you purchase and install an ENERGY STAR certified CAC system that satisfies at least a 15 SEER and 12.5 EER.
Who is eligible to receive the incentive?

Red tag

Your household’s healthy and comfortable lives are most important for us.We make sure that none of the heating appliances at your home are a potential threat to your life and the life of your loved ones. Nowadays many appliances use natural gas to operate which is highly combustible. It burns and can put everything on fire with a slight flame. Therefore any leak from heating and cooling appliances can cause serious problems. This problem could occur with any such devices but mainly with the furnaces and the water heaters.

Carbon monoxide begins to leak from old and unmaintained furnaces and spreads into the home without the homeowners could feel. It’s colourless, odourless and tasteless so there’s no way you would suspect the leak easily. That’s why there are red tags to make the process of detection easy. Canada’s law demands the tagging of furnaces that could be a threat to the lives of the homeowners. A red tag furnace means that your furnace needs prompt repairs and until the repairs are made, there would be no gas supply by the gas contractor.

RPM’s Fibre Cellulose Insulation is a non-toxic natural product produced from 100% recycled papers helping reduce landfill waste and preserves natural resources.
Eco-Friendly Cellulose Insulation also requires a fraction of the energy to produce (as well as producing less carbon dioxide) than fiberglass. It also helps protect your home’s peace and quiet through its effective noise reduction capabilities and keep your home comfortable year round by limiting heat flow.

****

When was the last time you ventured into your attic? If you are like most home owners, its been a while! Attics typically are often forgotten about until a roof leak occurs.
Since attics are often out of sight & out of mind, they easily become a breeding ground for mold. Believe it or not, attics are one of the most common places for mold growth in a home.

****

RPM’s team uses highly purified water to ensure your satisfaction with our window cleaning services in North America. No cleaning chemicals are required.
The latest innovations in pure water window cleaning come from pure water cleaning. Most water has tiny dissolved particles in it. Once the water dries on a surface, those particles become the spots you see left behind. Purified water is the key to leaving no spots or residue on windows.
The water-fed pole removes the environmental impact of chemicals by using pure water alone, while allowing operators to clean windows safely – and more quickly – from the ground. 
RPM uses the next generation of pure water-fed poles, systems, and accessories, taking our window cleaning business to new heights. RPM uses Northern Lite water-fed poles and brushes.
For the hard to get dirt we use the Tucker Hybrid brush with boar hair bristles.",the-rpm-groups,2018-04-16T20:27:01.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,"Insulation, Gutter Guards, Furnace, Air Conditioner","Attic Insulation, Mold Prevention, Mold Remediation, Gutter Guard Installation, Heating and Cooling Sales and Installation.","Climatizer, Owens Corning, Smart Screen, Amana, Goodman, Daikin",,2012,1,"cheque, credit card, finance ",,Certified Mold Remediator,National Association of Mold Remediation and Inspectors; ,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,above and beyond warranty ,1976829,The Rpm Groups ,19,16,19,9.9375,"Insulation, Home Insulation, Foam Insulation, Thermal Insulation, Fiberglass Insulation, cellulose insulation, insullation, celulose insulation, sprayfoam insulation, spray foam, what is insulation, insulating, insulated, insulate, insulator, save energy, insulators, foam insulation, insulation foam, foam spray, insulating foam, wall insulation, energy savers, radiant heat, sound insulation, spray in insulation, insulation spray in, insulation spray, spray on insulation, spray insulation, owenscorning, board insulation, insulation board, insulation home, insulation for the home, home insulation, loft insulation, foam insulation spray, insulation foam spray, spray insulation foam, spray on foam insulation, spray in foam insulation, insulation spray foam, spray foam insulation, foam spray insulation, insulation for attic, insulation in attic, attic insulation, insulation attic, insulating board, insulating foam spray, insulating spray foam, house insulation, insulation for house, insulation house, sprayfoam insulation, insulated panels, insulating home, soundproofing,Insulation, ,Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,",0,2018-04-16T20:27:43.000-04:00,therpmgroups,FALSE,0,0,24,0,FALSE,518f726dd96cec4d9087db758659482a60911681,TRUE,2022-07-17T14:24:21.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2226503,98.0291367495,376,NA,NA
