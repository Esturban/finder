We are a leading company that specializes in Shower Restoration Services and Tile and Grout Cleaning and Repairing

Over time grout surrounding tiles might crack or soften allowing moisture and bacteria to penetrate causing mold, mildew and water problems to occur. 

MOLD, DISCOLOURED GROUT, LOOSE TILES, AND PEALING CAULK/SILICONE are signs that you can't ignore and we are here to help you!

Our Restoration Services will help you avoid future water damage problems and leave your Shower looking brand new again for a fraction of the cost of a full bathroom renovation!
