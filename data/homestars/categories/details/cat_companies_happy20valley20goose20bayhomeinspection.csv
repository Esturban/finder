My Promise to You
Choosing the right inspector can be difficult. Unlike most professionals, you probably will not get to meet me until after you hire me. Other inspectors may offer a different set of qualifications and experience, and yes, they may even offer lower pricing. Ultimately a successful inspection will heavily depend on the inspector’s knowledge and own individual effort. Regardless of the task, I guarantee that I will give you my very best effort. This I promise you.
