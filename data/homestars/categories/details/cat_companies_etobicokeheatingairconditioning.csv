That's why we're taking extensive precautions before we enter your home bu disinfecting trucks and tools, washing hands, wearing proper protection equipment, and disinfecting anything we touch. Most of the work we do does not require any interaction with customers - approvals and payments are contactless.

Our History
Grant and Greg owe their business prowess to their grandfather, Tom Rodman, who perfected his skills in the sheet metal trade while working at the General Motor's plant in Oshawa before founding his own business, Rodman Sheet Metal, in 1949, during a time when sheet metal fittings were still produced by hand. Tom and his staff are responsible for the installation of hundreds of oil furnaces and duct systems in homes that were built across Ajax, Pickering, Whitby and Oshawa during the 1950s and 60s. Rodman Sheet Metal was eventually renamed to Rodman Heating.
In 1972, Greg and Grant's father, Ron Dainty, a certified Tool & Die Maker, joined the Rodman Heating team as a sheet metal apprentice. Ron expanded his skill set to include an expertise in oil and natural gas furnaces and central air conditioning. By 1975, Tom was ready to retire his tool belt, and handed the reigns of the business over to Ron. Under Ron's leadership, the company was once again re-branded, this time to reflect their new service offerings – Rodman Heating & Air Condition
Curious as youngsters, Greg and Grant grew up immersed in the family business. During the late 70s, they worked part time as summer students alongside their father. After graduating from college, the twins both took on full-time roles in family business, taking advantage of hands on learning in every aspect of the heating and cooling business. From the sweat and toil of the sheet metal shop producing custom duct work by hand, to the installing furnaces and air conditioners, to answering the phones and going on late-night service calls, they could do it all.  
When it was Ron's turn to retire and sell the business, Grant and Greg decided to translate their hands-on experience into a successful brand of their own, and so TWINTECH was born.
With over 30 years of experience under their belts and an unparalleled reputation for delivering superior service, TWINTECH has been able to develop and maintain the long-term customer relationships that make them the envy of the industry.",twintech-heating-cooling-inc,2015-12-21T15:43:56.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Furnace

Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

The technology was developed within the Indoor Environment Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose IAQ scientists tested it. The research was funded by US Environmental protection agency, US dept. of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and California Institute of Energy and Environment.

The University of California was granted initial patents in 1996 and 1999, and Aeroseal holds an exclusive license to the technology.",aeroseal-tech-inc,2015-01-23T22:44:19.000-05:00,NA,NA,,"Aeroseal, Smart Thermostats and more..","Toronto, GTA, Vaughan, York Region, Richmond Hill, King City, Bolton, Beeton, Aurora, Markham, Uxbridge, Newmarket, Sharon, Bradford, Simcoe County, Barrie, Aliston, Muskoka, Durham Region, Ajax, Pickering, Whitby, Oshawa, Bowmanville, Peterborough, Peel Region, Caledon, Orangeville, Georgetown, Schomberg,Mississauga, Milton, Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, Waterdown, Stoney Creek, Niagara Region, Guelph , Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and more..","Aeroseal, Pearl Homes",Complete customer service to achieve maximum results.,2004,4,"Credit Cards, Cheque, Cash.",,General Contractor/ Renovator,,TRUE,TRUE,Custom,1,TRUE,FALSE,10 Year Warranty,1927753,Aeroseal Tech Inc.,205,193,43,9.98446,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Solar Panels, Solar Panels, Solar Panel, ,Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating Installation, Heating,",0,aerosealtech,FALSE,0,0,52,0,FALSE,7c5d2bf68480644b0a629f7cfd19af8238a703b4,TRUE,2021-04-01T14:01:21.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2011849,98.076792316,376,NA,NA,NA

Air Purification

The air in your home, for the most part, is the same air being re-circulated over and over again - contaminants included. These contaminants include mold, viruses, pet dander, pollens and household toxins to name a few. There are a variety of options for air purifiers, at all budget levels, that can help you take the next step in a healthier home. LG Home Comfort technicians can guide you through the simplest room solutions right up to whole home air purifiers with hepa filters and UV-C lights. At LG Home Comfort we are confident that we can find an air purification solution for your home.

 

Contact us today to book your air purification installation.

Water Purification

Your homes’ water is an essential part of your everyday life - everything you do in your home requires it! But did you know the quality of your water can also affect the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances? Hard water can cause internal build up of minerals in your washing machine, dishwasher and hot water heater. The level of water purification your home needs depends on the combination of your current water and what outcomes you are looking for.

We offer a full range of water treatment options: softeners, chlorine & iron filters and reverse osmosis units. Allow the LG team to test your water, free of charge, and design a water purification system that gives you the best water possible.

 

Contact us today to book your water purification installation or a complimentary water test.

Heating

Whether you require a tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace, let our professional team of technicians evaluate your needs and walk you through your heating options. A poorly designed and installed system can lead to low efficiency and increased operating costs - at LG Home Comfort we take the time to customize each installation to ensure peak performance and efficiency.

 

Contact us today to book your tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace appointment.

Cooling

When it comes to cooling, reliability and consistency is key. Every home is unique, which is why our team will take the time to assess your home, your cooling needs and come up with a solution that fits your needs and your budget.

 

Contact us today to book your AC repair, maintenance or installation appointment.

Water

Installing over 1000 water heaters per month, we are experts at heating your home water. Whether you need a simple repair or a new system, our technicians will walk you through the process and explain your different options. Our no-pressure sales guarantee will ensure that you can make a decision in your own time, with all of the information you need.

Hi, and welcome to Interior Climate Solutions!
My name is Nick Baker, and I am the founder of ICS. This company has grown far beyond my expectations and I couldn't be more thankful to my friends and neighbours for trusting me to service, and replace their HVAC systems to help keep the company up and running in the early days.
Now we are a small team of fully licensed technicians that have a combined 40 years experience in the trades.  We are registered with the Technical Standard Safety Authority and the Ontario Colleges Of Trades.
Our goal is to offer our customers a stress free experience in a high stress area of work. Having your furnace breakdown in the middle of winter, or your AC quit on you during our hot summer days can be a nightmare. Eliminate that stress by knowing who to call before it happens, and deal with a small company that is tailored to suit your every need. We have reduced prices compared to the big name companies, and offer a high quality product as well as a higher quality customer experience. 
In our business, the customer comes first, satisfaction is our guarantee, and we have a strong warranty to ensure that you feel confident in your choice to hire Interior Climate Solutions.

We look forward to working with you!

For new and existing homes we provide the experience, knowledge and friendly customer service to design, install, maintain and repair all types of heating systems. Specialize in hot water heating systems, we work with radiators, gas boilers, hybrid system, tankless water heaters, hydronic radiant heating systems (radiant floors) and solar heating. We also install natural gas furnaces.

At EXTEL Gas services Inc our service and knowledgeable installation technician will explain and help you choose the right air conditioning system to fit your home cooling needs.

We specialize in installing split system air conditioning systems, and ductless air conditioning systems. Call us for your home air conditioning (AC) needs and stay cool in the summer at a low cost.

We also provide HVAC Installation and Maintenance service for small commercial buildings or residential house. For new or existing buildings we can install custom sheet metal ducts that have been designed for your forced air heating and cooling needs, using quality air handlers, and natural gas furnaces that move air effectively and efficiently to maintain a consistent indoor environment for all seasons of the year.

Our company has helped those families during winter blizzards, as well as families on the other end of the spectrum, being stranded without a functioning air conditioner when it’s hot out in Toronto. In either situation, our customers just want the job to be done appropriately in an efficient manner. So, our standards aim to match those needs. We’re available every hour of the day for service calls, we have same-day service options and our technicians are prompt and reliable.

We also know that it’s not always exciting to spend your hard-earned dollars on HVAC, which is why our company works to make it affordable. With in-home cost estimates, you’ll know exactly how much you’re spending and what you’ll receive for that money. Additionally, your energy bills can go down after making sure that your HVAC Systems are as efficient as they can be.

If you have questions or comments about solutions we can provide, we urge you to give us a call at 416 849 7997 or schedule an appointment online. While you may be paying for an air conditioner, what you’re really receiving is peace of mind – and we’re happy to provide it for you.",extel-gas,2018-07-29T16:16:57.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,"Heating Installation & Service, AC Installation & Service, Gas Lines, Fire Places, Furnaces, Boilers, Hot Water Heaters

Installation
───
Providing the optimal combination of energy efficiency and comfort our furnaces and air conditioners will save you more money while also doing their part to help the environment.
It doesn’t hurt to consider a furnace with an Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency, also known as a AFUE rating, and an air conditioner with higher SEER ratings. 
A higher rating indicates that the furnace and air conditioner are more energy efficient, will last longer and will save you money. 
But this is only possible if it's installed to A.C.S's high standards.

Attic Insulation
───
As experts we at A.C.S. agree that the majority of heat loss or gain that takes place in a home is done through its attic. 
This estimated heat loss can be as high as 45% depending on what type of insulation your attic has. 
With an alarming potential for heat loss like that it’s easy to see why you need to pay special attention to how your attic is insulated. 
In winter, when you heat your home that heat rises and your attic insulation is the first line of defense to stop that heat loss and save energy. In summer, hot humid air also penetrates into your attic and makes your home harder to cool. 

Hot Water Heating
───
After home heating, hot water tanks consume the most energy in your home. 
Control your home energy costs by choosing a more energy-efficient hot water tank .
Owning a new Water Tank helps manage cash flow, and comfort! 
Get a Smart Solution for Hot Water Heating. 
Old tanks generally contain build- up and sediment that makes it less efficient and water quality suffers.

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA.

AIR-CONDITIONING INSTALLATION AND REPAIR
Hiring an air conditioner installation service is important if you want to have the air conditioning unit properly added to your home and have it functioning for years to come. While there is plenty of information available on the internet that might allow for you to embark on a do-it-yourself project you will want a qualified professional to do the job so you don't encounter any issues later on. The process of installing an air conditioner onto your HVAC system is a very labor intensive and involved process that requires someone who has experience in the field.
Installation of an air conditioning unit requires a lot of different tasks to be completed. Electrical work is involved as well as plumbing work. Neither of these are easy to do unless you know what you are doing and if you slip up with either during installation it can cost you a lot of money to fix. You are installing something onto your HVAC system and you don't want to cause damage to your furnace as well. When dealing with the moisture that needs to be properly removed from the air conditioning unit you will want to ensure that moisture goes where it needs to instead of damaging your home or the air conditioning unit.

HEATING SYSTEM INSTALLATION AND REPAIR
Hiring a professional plumber for installing or replacing a furnace is recommended rather than DIY. This is because there are many things that can be overlooked by the typical lay person. A trained specialist knows exactly what to look for and how to spot potential problems before they arise. Professionals have been through the proper training and installed numerous furnaces on a daily basis.The experience alone is worth the money spent to hire a well trained professional. Someone who installs furnaces on a regular basis is familiar with a variety of different brands of furnaces and has had experience installing each unique brand. By installing or replacing the furnace yourself, you could damage part of the unit and it usually isn't covered by a warranty. With a specialist installing the furnace, should anything damage the unit, the warranty is still effective.

We think of the 3 pillars of our foundation...

One...We are dedicated to providing homeowners with complete home energy saving solutions. When we say “COMPLETE”, WE MEAN IT! Most companies sell solely based on what they can offer. We believe that much like a doctor, every home needs to be diagnosed based on their own deficiencies.

Two...We offer a better line of products and services, all across the board! While the majority of companies offer products that insider’s call “builder grade”. Essentially a “cheaper” line of product, made to the masses. We have aligned ourselves with companies such as; York – an industry leader in HVAC, and Vinyl Guard – who offer a LIFETIME GUARANTEE on their windows and doors... Just to name a few. 

Three...We do it right! Our technicians know that our mission is to treat YOUR home better that our own. All of our installations are done by an Authorized, Licensed, Green Authority Technician. By not outsourcing the installation process, we can make sure that quality control is top notch.

In a free, one hour, in home consultation, one of our Efficiency Advisors can offer great solutions in making your home energy efficient.
