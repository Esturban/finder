All our plumbers are 100% licensed, insured and commission-free! We take great pride in being one of the most reviewed companies on HomeStars in North America! We are also proud to say that we have been chosen (twice) as the ""best plumber in the city"" by Toronto Life magazine, as evidenced by their ""Busy person's survival guide"" issue. High praise from a wonderful and trusted publication! 

We employ full-time salaried plumbers rather than commission-based plumbers that are motivated to up-sell you. All of the DrainWorks plumbers in Toronto and surrounding areas are fully licensed, insured, and professionally trained. We are also proud to say that 100% of our employees have been with us for 10 years or more. Finally, an experienced local plumber near you that you can trust and rely on!
 
Further, we've recently had the honor of being one of a select few companies across all trades, hand picked by Gemini award winning TV host and contractor, Bryan Baeumler, of HGTV's Leave it to Bryan and Disaster DIY to be Baeumler Approved. A high mark of quality, indeed. 
 
You can count on DrainWorks for all your plumbing and drain-related needs in Toronto. Our plumbers are ready for your call with clear and upfront pricing and will always arrive on-time and fully prepared with everything they can foreseeably need.

DrainWorks Plumbing also likes to help and support our local Toronto community and charities, such as for the Easter Seals and SickKids Foundation.
Please take a few moments to read these plumbing reviews from our customers, so you too can learn about and take advantage of the â€˜DrainWorks Differenceâ€™. We hope you choose us for your next call to the plumber!

<br />Tired of mopping the water in your basement? Does your basement smell of mould and mildew? Is your foundation wall retaining water slowly and deteriorating? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, then the following will describe the reasons why, and how, to eliminate the problem. The cause of your basement's musty smell is because your foundation wall is retaining water, be it in the hollow block cavities or trapped behind the double brick or stone wall, as well as the water that is absorbed by the block, brick and stone. This combination causes the wall to produce mould, mildew and epharecense. The water trapped in the wall slowly deteriorates the wall, starting at the bottom.The water that makes its way into the basement through the wall and seems to cause us the most grief may not be the most concerning problem. The same problem will not occur with a solid poured concrete wall. The reason being you will find a defined crack in the solid wall that allows all the water to enter in, without retaining little, or any water.Regardless of which type of foundation you have, it can become watertight, mould and mildew-free by sealing your foundation from the OUTSIDE. With solid poured concrete foundations, you can inject the crack from the inside and the elements stay out.You must expose your foundation wall from grade level to 6"" below the top of the footing. Then you must clean the wall thoroughly, exposing the deteriorated areas and cleaning all the dust and dirt from the wall. Then, restore any cracks or loose mortar joints with hydrolic cement. Cement coat the wall,Tar and install 6mm poly plastic on top. Once the wall is treated, install a 4"" continuous weeping tile covered with 6 inches of 3/4"" stone. Then back-fill the earth compacting at every foot. At grade level slope the earth, concrete, interlocking etc. away from the house.This method never fails. I have used this system over 13 years without fail. I have the references for you to refer to. We also have a photo album to take you step by step through the procedure.So, stop mopping! Relieve your allergies from mold and mildew and restore your foundation. When you do decide to restore your foundation do it the right way - from the outside. Remember, 40% of all my work is fixing other people's attempt to stop the water.",mud-monkeys-waterproofing,2007-09-10T16:08:20.000-04:00,NA,"For interior and exterior waterproofing, as well as benching and underpinning we will work south of 401 to the lake from Victoria Park to Kipling.",24 hrs (365 days),,"Interior/Exterior Waterproofing, Benching, Underpinning, Concrete Floors",,,1996,25,"We now accept debit and credit (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), as well as cheques",We will gladly send our customers a copy of our liability insurance at their request,Yes,,TRUE,FALSE,,We will gladly send our customers a copy of our WSIB clearance certificate at their request,TRUE,FALSE,All waterproofing work completed by Mud Monkey's Inc. carries a 20 year transferable warranty,104643,Mud Monkeys Waterproofing,331,306,103,9.9183,"Waterproofing, Basement Waterproofing, Foundation Waterproofing, Waterproofing Contractor, Water, Waterproof, Wet Basement, Leaky Basement, Flood, Flooded Basement, Flooding ,Waterproofing, Basement leaks, underpinning, caulking,,",3,2008-09-10T14:55:25.000-04:00,mudmonkeys,FALSE,0,0,82,100,FALSE,cc8d0b2333a0562ab0f243dfe1ec1a812e78ec22,TRUE,2022-05-25T10:02:24.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,1827980,98.4603043779,448,NA,NA

Most people do not know what is more distressing A) Having a plumbing problem or B) Having a pushy salesman in their home selling excessive services at outrageous prices. Advanced plumbing operates differently. Our family run business with two generations of plumbers take pride â€¦

No more unattended drainage problem resulting in slow running drains especially in the kitchen, laundry and bathrooms. Snaking is often successful but hydro jetting could be the answer to remove oil and grease settled in the drain.

Let Advanced Plumbing analyze and diagnose your drain buildup, blockages, or cracks in the pipes which can lead to overflowing sinks and backed-up toilets. Prevent a catastrophic sewer flood by installing an inexpensive backwater valve.

Let us stop your toilet from constantly running or from the tank filling up on its own. We can service or if required replace your toilet.

Whether you are renovating your house or splurging on a new shower, take advantage of our bathtub and shower installation services.
