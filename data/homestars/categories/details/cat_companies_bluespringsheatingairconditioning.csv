<br />- we also have (6) SIX CVI (Certified Ventilation Inspectors) on staff that can inspect your residential, commercial or industrial HVAC systems.
<br />- NADCA publishes the names of individuals that hold the ASCS designation, make sure your home is being cleaned by a certified and qualified individual; to find out if your technician is certified, please visit: www.nadca.com

<br />- the length of time it takes to clean an HVAC system is NOT dependent on type of equipment used; provided equipment conforms to NADCA standards
<br />- time it takes to clean an HVAC system is dependent on: 1) ACCESS 2) SIZE OF HVAC  SYSTEM 3) TYPE OF HVAC SYSTEM 4) OTHER SERVICES PERFORMED - each HVAC system is different and should be treated as such!
<br />- NADCA certified professionals have the ability to properly assess, maintain and restore all types of HVAC systems

Air Purification

The air in your home, for the most part, is the same air being re-circulated over and over again - contaminants included. These contaminants include mold, viruses, pet dander, pollens and household toxins to name a few. There are a variety of options for air purifiers, at all budget levels, that can help you take the next step in a healthier home. LG Home Comfort technicians can guide you through the simplest room solutions right up to whole home air purifiers with hepa filters and UV-C lights. At LG Home Comfort we are confident that we can find an air purification solution for your home.

 

Contact us today to book your air purification installation.

Water Purification

Your homes’ water is an essential part of your everyday life - everything you do in your home requires it! But did you know the quality of your water can also affect the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances? Hard water can cause internal build up of minerals in your washing machine, dishwasher and hot water heater. The level of water purification your home needs depends on the combination of your current water and what outcomes you are looking for.

We offer a full range of water treatment options: softeners, chlorine & iron filters and reverse osmosis units. Allow the LG team to test your water, free of charge, and design a water purification system that gives you the best water possible.

 

Contact us today to book your water purification installation or a complimentary water test.

Heating

Whether you require a tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace, let our professional team of technicians evaluate your needs and walk you through your heating options. A poorly designed and installed system can lead to low efficiency and increased operating costs - at LG Home Comfort we take the time to customize each installation to ensure peak performance and efficiency.

 

Contact us today to book your tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace appointment.

Cooling

When it comes to cooling, reliability and consistency is key. Every home is unique, which is why our team will take the time to assess your home, your cooling needs and come up with a solution that fits your needs and your budget.

 

Contact us today to book your AC repair, maintenance or installation appointment.

Water

Installing over 1000 water heaters per month, we are experts at heating your home water. Whether you need a simple repair or a new system, our technicians will walk you through the process and explain your different options. Our no-pressure sales guarantee will ensure that you can make a decision in your own time, with all of the information you need.

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA.
