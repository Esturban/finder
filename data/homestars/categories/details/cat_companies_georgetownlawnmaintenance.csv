Now there’s a way to stop thinking ""The grass is greener on the other side""! Weed-A-Way’s premium lawn care products and services will make your dream lawn a stunning reality. Here’s how:

*As industry leaders and certified IPM (Integrated Pest Management) specialists, our lawn care programs utilize the most advanced turf management practices and products.

*Our lawn amendment treatments as well as lawn care programs promote a vibrant landscape.

*Depending upon weather conditions, we use a combination of Liquid and Granular fertilizers. Of course, if you prefer Granular, just let us know.

*We guarantee results with our fertilizer and weed control programs. If after an application stubborn weed persists we'll come back and re-spray at no charge.

<b>Our services consist of the following programs and additional services: </b>

<b>*Basic (Fertilizer & Weed Control) Lawn Care Program</b>

 <b>*Intermediate Organic Lawn Care Program</b>

 <b>*Advanced Lawn Care Program</b>

 <b>*Weed Control:</b> FIESTA: A highly-recommended timely weed control which is composed of iron and is odourless, Fiesta kills the weeds but does not harm the lawn. It is applied by our highly qualified technicians throughout your season long program. Weeds compete with grass and plants for nutrients, water and sunlight. Broadleaf weeds are usually the greatest threat. If not dealt with quickly, they can destroy all your hard work. Effective weed control solutions from Weed-A-Way lawn services will ensure a healthy and vibrant lawn. We have extensive experience in dealing with various types of weeds like dandelion, broadleaf plantain, etc., and know how to deal with each one.

 <b>*Core Aeration:</b> The secret to a lush, green lawn is core aeration. Soil compacts over time and especially with traffic. Core aeration allows nutrients, water and oxygen to reach grass roots more easily. However, lawn aeration is more than just punching holes in the ground. You must have the proper equipment and be willing to set aside a couple of hours for aeration. It’s also important to know when your garden needs core aeration. Weed-A-Way’s lawn services take the trial and error out of grass treatments. We make sure that the grass is always green on your side of the fence. 

 <b>*Grub Treatment:</b> Typically, grubs attack grass roots. A damaged root system results in a poor quality lawn with dirty, yellowish brown patches. Timely grub treatment from Weed-A-Way will avoid the huge expense of replacing your lawn as well as eliminate the threat of skunks and raccoons that feed on them. By using natural grub treatments like nematodes (naturally occurring microscopic worms) to destroy them and alfalfa treatments to stimulate roots, increase growth and drought resistance, our efficient lawn services will ensure a strong and healthy turf. 

 <b>*Crab Grass Control:</b> Crabgrass forms thick clumps of light green leaves that are highly competitive with turf grasses. It turns brownish red in mid to late summer. Timely treatments are the most effective way to deal with crabgrass. Since this lawn problem germinates from seeds in spring it’s extremely important to apply the crabgrass control treatment before germination takes place. 

 <b>*Lime Treatment:</b> In order to have healthy soil that supports grass growth, it is important to maintain the appropriate pH (acidity) balance. Using lime treatment is often the best solution. Although some lawn experts recommend lime treatment before starting a lawn, applications on mature turf also have several benefits. However, in order for your lime treatment to be effective, you must have knowledge of your soil’s pH levels. Our experienced lawn services will analyze a soil sample before applying lime treatment to your grass. We make sure we get it done right. 

 <b>*Surface Insect Control:</b> Chinch bugs, sod webworms, cutworms and other surface insects usually strike in the summer. They are so small and usually buried in the lawn thatch; that’s why it so hard to spot them. Very often insect ridden grass looks dry and you might think it simply needs watering. Since your lawn is already stressed with the heat, drought-like conditions, weeds and traffic, the damage is greater. Weed-A-Way surface insect treatment means identifying your problems quickly and correctly, and then taking the appropriate control measures to eliminate the pests. 

<b>*Overseeding and Core Aeration:</b> Core aeration makes your overseeding efforts worthwhile. By unplugging the soil in a methodical way, you can remove thatch and reduce soil compaction as well as increase success of weed, surface insect and lime treatments. But a significant benefit of core aeration with regard to overseeding is that it allows the nutrients to reach the seeds and roots faster. Our expert lawn services can handle your overseeding and core aeration requirements to ensure proper effectiveness.",weed-a-way,2008-01-23T10:37:56.000-05:00,NA,,,,,,,1976,20,"Visa/Masercard, Online Banking",,,BBB Acreditation,TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,FALSE,,79886,Weed A Way Ltd.,349,270,44,8.38889,"Lawn Maintenance, Lawn Care, Lawn Mowers, Lawn Maintenance Companies, grass cutters, grass cutting, shrub pruning, lawns, a lawns, landscaping, mowing, lawn mowers, mowing lawn, lawn mowing, mowing the lawns, mowing lawns, lawns mowing, yard and garden, maintenance lawn, lawns maintenance, lawncare, service lawn, lawn service, grass mowing, lawn treatment, green grass, lawn repair, grass lawn mowers, lawn & landscape, lawn landscape, a lawn and landscape, landscape and lawn, lawn and landscape, lawn services, yard landscape, lawn maintenance service, lawn service maintenance, landscaping a yard, yard landscaping, lawn maintenance services, maintenance company, grass cutting, maintenance business, lawn business, leaf clean up, fall leaves, hedges ,",0,2010-12-20T10:04:20.000-05:00,weedaway,FALSE,0,0,49,100,FALSE,3bfd47af91e2f14e8f6aa6e82c4a3375985ac1f0,TRUE,2022-02-14T09:43:13.000-05:00,TRUE,TRUE,1814032,81.9345988986,397,NA,NA
