Janet Hamilton is the owner and president of Paint It Like New! Inc .Janet has been a long time fan of home decor both inside and out, watching every type of decor show available. “Repurposing and recycling furniture has been a passion of mine from a young age. Learning new skills and feeling comfortable with different types of power tools has always been a part of my life. Picking up a spray gun, seemed like a natural transition.”

Discovering a need for furniture re-spraying in the GTA and the Golden Horseshoe, Janet put together a business plan and strategy to capitalize on a market she believed had incredible potential — providing quality paint re-spraying of indoor/outdoor furniture at an affordable price.

Paint It Like New! had it’s grand opening in Burlington in 2009. The budding company grew quickly, enjoying tremendous success with a steadily growing list of satisfied clients.

“It has also been exciting to spray projects for some of my favourite decorating shows!”

Since 2009 Paint It Like New! has been involved with projects for CityLine, Income Property, Love It or List it, Bryan Baeumler shows, Style at Home Magazine, Canadian House and Home, Chatelaine Magazine and featured in the Toronto Star Newspaper.

“I love what I do,” quips Janet. “If you’re passionate about something you’ll deliver higher quality and that passion will be obvious to your clients.”
