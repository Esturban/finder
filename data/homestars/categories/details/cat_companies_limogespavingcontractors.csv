Chris, at a young age, started his company with only himself as the sole employee knocking door to door selling driveway sealing service. Over time, Canark Paving has become the biggest provider of driveway sealing in the city with 5 employees. The company started to grow and inevitably, working with asphalt is the next step. Canark Paving did driveway cut-outs, repairing only parts of the driveway that were visibly damaged. They did mostly small paving repair jobs such as pothole repairs, commercial parking lot repairs, and asphalt ramps. Meanwhile, Canark Paving also had interlock projects on the interim. Fast forward to 2020, Canark Paving has grown with 20 employees running the sealing, interlock, and paving divisions. It has become a trusted paving company in Ottawa by focusing on customer experience and high-quality workmanship.
