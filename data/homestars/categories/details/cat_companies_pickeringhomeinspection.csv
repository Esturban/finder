As your Home and Mold Inspector,  Ambicorp Property Inspections look beyond the aesthetic attributes of a home and inspect for defects or deficiencies that may lead to costly repairs in the future.

As my client, you will have the knowledge you need to make an informed decision on your biggest purchase and investment and the place that you will call home.

The lab report details the species of mold, the spore concentration and any known health problems or allergic reactions that may be associated with the mold.   Some people have allergies to pets such as dogs and cats, while others have allergies or concerns about cockroaches, rats, mice and dust mites.  Did you know we also test the air for allergens?

Heard (President of GDHI) is a local resident of Durham for over 40 years. Familiar with the community and local businesses, he brings a strong technical background including 20 years of Senior Manufacturing Management experience and over 30 years of home renovations/home inspection services to the business.
Greater Durham Home Inspections is a proud member of the Ajax/Pickering board of trade and the Whitby chamber of commerce. With many years of quality inspections completed we are able to support our customer's ongoing home inspection needs. All of our home inspectors are fully trained and have extensive years of experience in this field as well as on-going education. We believe in the philosophy of “Great Service and Customer Care”. We stand behind our reports and remain available to you, the purchaser for free telephone consulting once you move into your home.
As a Director of ACHI (Alliance of Canadian Home Inspectors) Garry Heard continues to support the Home Inspection industry and understands the importance of selecting a qualified inspector.  Today's inspectors should be certified in Thermography (Infrared), Mould and Home Inspection. We are seeing far too many under certified Inspectors doing home inspections.
Garry Heard has worked hard to obtain all the required certifications including Commercial, Home, Thermal Imaging (Thermography) and Mould Certification.
