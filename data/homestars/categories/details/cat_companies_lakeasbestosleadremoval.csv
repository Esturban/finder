No matter where you live, the risks associated with asbestos exposure are very real. If you are involved in the trades, or you work in an industrial setting, you need to be especially aware of your surrounding environment. Construction and demolition crews working in hospitals, schools, manufacturing plants, and even residential homes are potentially at risk anytime old components are being removed including insulation, carpeting, wiring, wallboard, popcorn ceilings, siding, roofing, plaster, and many others.
.
.
Limiting oneâ€™s exposure to mould at home or work is extremely important as peopleâ€™s reactions to this fungus can vary drastically. Some may suffer only a sore throat while others may experience asthma-like symptoms and shortness of breath. Window sills, fabrics, cardboard boxes, basements, and rooms with water taps are all susceptible to excess moisture build-up. Dark spots and a musty odor indicate its presence, but unfortunately mould also thrives in locations you canâ€™t easily see: above the ceiling tiles, inside cupboards and closets, and even behind the wallpaper and walls. Renew Air in Scarborough offers mould remediation for residential and commercial customers across Canada.
.
.
When it comes to dealing with hazardous materials, you should demand a team that can verify the safety of your job site or living space with absolute certainty. We are fully licensed and prepared to answer the call 24/7. We donâ€™t consider the job done until you are completely satisfied. With our competitive pricing, we have been kept very busy throughout the years.
