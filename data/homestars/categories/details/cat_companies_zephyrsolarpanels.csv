Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

The technology was developed within the Indoor Environment Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose IAQ scientists tested it. The research was funded by US Environmental protection agency, US dept. of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and California Institute of Energy and Environment.

The University of California was granted initial patents in 1996 and 1999, and Aeroseal holds an exclusive license to the technology.",aeroseal-tech-inc,2015-01-23T22:44:19.000-05:00,NA,NA,,"Aeroseal, Smart Thermostats and more..","Toronto, GTA, Vaughan, York Region, Richmond Hill, King City, Bolton, Beeton, Aurora, Markham, Uxbridge, Newmarket, Sharon, Bradford, Simcoe County, Barrie, Aliston, Muskoka, Durham Region, Ajax, Pickering, Whitby, Oshawa, Bowmanville, Peterborough, Peel Region, Caledon, Orangeville, Georgetown, Schomberg,Mississauga, Milton, Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, Waterdown, Stoney Creek, Niagara Region, Guelph , Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and more..","Aeroseal, Pearl Homes",Complete customer service to achieve maximum results.,2004,4,"Credit Cards, Cheque, Cash.",,General Contractor/ Renovator,,TRUE,TRUE,Custom,1,TRUE,FALSE,10 Year Warranty,1927753,Aeroseal Tech Inc.,205,193,43,9.98446,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Solar Panels, Solar Panels, Solar Panel, ,Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating Installation, Heating,",0,aerosealtech,FALSE,0,0,52,0,FALSE,7c5d2bf68480644b0a629f7cfd19af8238a703b4,TRUE,2021-04-01T14:01:21.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2213298,98.1110665711,475,NA,NA
