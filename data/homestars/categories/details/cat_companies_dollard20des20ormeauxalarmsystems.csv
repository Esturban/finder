For over 125 years, we’ve made protecting and connecting the centerpiece of what we do.

1874-1890:
First security system network
It all started on April 5, 1874, with a nighttime break-in. American District Telegraph (ADT) founder Edward Callahan created a telegraph-based “call box” to signal for assistance to a central office. He quickly connected 50 other homes in the neighbourhood, creating the first residential security system network.



1890-1920: R​​oundsmen
ADT introduced the first proactive security monitoring and response service, employing roundsmen to make rounds each night of customers’ homes to help prevent crime before it happened.



ADT’s first president
Robert C. Clowry was ADT’s first president. He was also a colonel in the US military. He worked his way up from messenger boy, eventually serving as president of both Western Union and ADT which he led for eight years.



1920-1940:
Central monitoring centres
ADT pioneered the concept of the central monitoring centre, enabling thousands of customers to link to 24/7/365 monitoring and protection.





1940-1989:
First burglar system
ADT started its first big expansion in the 1940s after pioneering the first automated burglar system. At the same time, ADT installed the first automated fire alarm system providing immediate response to fire.



1989-2010:
Secured by ADT
A new ADT security feature gained immediate customer approval: the iconic ADT yard sign which now dots thousands of yards across the country.



2014:
Reliance Protectron
In July 2014, ADT purchased Reliance Protectron Inc., at the time Canada’s second-largest security services provider with 400,000 customers from coast to coast.




2010-2017:
ADT Interactive Services
ADT elevated home intelligence when it launched Interactive Services, the app that lets customers remotely access and control their home security system, as well as lighting, climate control, video surveillance and much more..



Present:
Creating customers for life
Much has changed since our humble beginnings in 1874. One thing that hasn’t is our desire to constantly improve. So we combined forces with Protection 1 to further raise our standards for customer security and service.

Intrusion monitoring
A home intrusion not only means the theft of your belongings. Even if they are insured, nothing can replace their sentimental value. An intrusion also leaves a sense of violation. 

 

Our state-of-the-art monitoring centres keep an eye on your home 24/7 and are ready to respond when an alarm occurs.

 

Nowadays, being at home is no longer a deterrent to theft. That’s why we are there for you at all times!

 

The intrusion monitoring service is included in all our packages.

Fire monitoring
Help protect your family and home from fire and smoke! Even if you have smoke detectors, who will call the fire department when you are out? And since smoke is toxic, what will happen if you are there but sound asleep?

 

Choose our fire monitoring service! Our monitoring centres can call the appropriate emergency services when you are away from home or are unable to answer.

 

The fire monitoring service is included in all our packages.

Emergency services
Request assistance from emergency services directly using your keypad or optional wireless emergency button! Better yet, this service is FREE with the intrusion monitoring!

Flooding monitoring
Be notified of flood risks to help reduce or prevent damage caused by water! An appliance that stops working, a pipe that is frozen or punctured, or a damaged sump pump: you’re protected!

 

Carbon monoxide monitoring
Protect yourself and your loved ones against carbon monoxide.
 
Odourless and colourless, this gas is impossible to detect.
 
Our detectors help protect you by alerting you to the presence of this dangerous gas and immediately notifying our monitoring centres.

 

Monitoring of extreme temperature fluctuations
Being informed of abnormal temperature fluctuations can help prevent pipe damage caused by frost. This will help you prevent frozen pipes from bursting, which can often happen if your home’s central heating system breaks down.",,"​An outstanding network of monitoring stations
We own and operate a nationwide network of three monitoring stations which are interconnected for complete redundancy. In the event of a major power outage or a natural catastrophe, all alarm signals are automatically forwarded to another station to ensure uninterrupted service.

ADT monitoring centres map
Five Diamond Certification:
Our monitoring stations have earned the Five Diamond Certification from The Monitoring Association (TMA, formerly known as the Central Station Alarm Association), one of the most important governing bodies in the alarm industry. This means our central station operators, who are the first line of defense in emergency response, undergo regular professional training and maintain high performance levels in alarm response handling.

Underwriter Laboratories Certification (ULC):
