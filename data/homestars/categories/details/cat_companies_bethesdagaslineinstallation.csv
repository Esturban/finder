We also install natural gas furnaces.

At EXTEL Gas services Inc our service and knowledgeable installation technician will explain and help you choose the right air conditioning system to fit your home cooling needs.

We specialize in installing split system air conditioning systems, and ductless air conditioning systems. Call us for your home air conditioning (AC) needs and stay cool in the summer at a low cost.

We also provide HVAC Installation and Maintenance service for small commercial buildings or residential house. For new or existing buildings we can install custom sheet metal ducts that have been designed for your forced air heating and cooling needs, using quality air handlers, and natural gas furnaces that move air effectively and efficiently to maintain a consistent indoor environment for all seasons of the year.

Our company has helped those families during winter blizzards, as well as families on the other end of the spectrum, being stranded without a functioning air conditioner when it’s hot out in Toronto. In either situation, our customers just want the job to be done appropriately in an efficient manner. So, our standards aim to match those needs. We’re available every hour of the day for service calls, we have same-day service options and our technicians are prompt and reliable.

We also know that it’s not always exciting to spend your hard-earned dollars on HVAC, which is why our company works to make it affordable. With in-home cost estimates, you’ll know exactly how much you’re spending and what you’ll receive for that money. Additionally, your energy bills can go down after making sure that your HVAC Systems are as efficient as they can be.
