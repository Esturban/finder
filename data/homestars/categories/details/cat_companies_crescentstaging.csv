While there are many staging companies on the market, none of them provides the staging quality per dollar we are looking for when we are trying to sell our own property. As such, we see an opportunity to create a better company that provides outstanding staging quality and value than what was available on the market.

R3 Home Staging specializes in providing the highest staging quality per dollar. We strongly believe this is the best way to deliver the best value to our clients.

Through a long streak of wildly successful projects and word of mouth, we are growing faster than we ever anticipated. We believe our integrity, core values and unique presentation styles play a strong part in our rapid growth.

R3 Home Staging provides differentiating designs to showcase a property’s strengths. We understand the market and consistently helps our clients achieve record breaking sale prices in many neighborhoods across GTA.

What makes R3 Home Staging different is we do not cut corners. We treat each property like our own and work diligently to ensure each of our projects meet our high bar of quality and exceptional presentation.

We create an atmosphere for the potential buyer to feel at home while touring the property.
With 80% of potential buyers searching the internet, your home needs to stand out. It only takes 10 seconds for a potential buyer to make a decision about your home therefore it is very important to make a good first impression.

According to the National Association of Realtors, and reported by forbes.com, for every $100 invested in staging, the potential return is $400. “A staged home will sell for 17% more on average than a non-staged home, and 95% of staged homes sell in 11 days or less. That is statistically 87% faster than non-staged homes.”

Because buying a home is such an emotional process, a small detail can make or break a deal. Meet The Stagers understand what influences your prospects which will help get your house sold.

Our commitment to quality and service ensures that our clients are happy. Making everyone feel at home is our job and the beauty that comes with it is our passion!",meet-the-stagers,2021-03-15T19:58:56.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,,2016111,Meet The Stagers,0,0,16,NA,"Home Staging, Home Staging, Real Estate Staging, House Staging, staging a house for sale, staging a home for sale, fluffing a house, fluffing a home, home fluffer, house fluffer, decorate, furniture rental,",0,,FALSE,0,0,17,0,FALSE,518d6335f600d2d8296595739df85f4d42963f2f,FALSE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,2248783,-1.0,437,NA,NA,2021-03-15T19:59:23.000-04:00
