Whether you are a Homeowner involved in remodeling, renovating or retrofitting your home, or an Industry Professional or Contractor looking for a reputable insulation contractor for your next project, we can deliver reliable and prompt service at a competitive price, using only the highest quality Canadian-manufactured cellulose insulation on the market today. 
With the cost of living skyrocketing, saving money by saving energy has never been more important. Heating and cooling costs can account for 50-70% of a home or building’s yearly energy expense. When installed correctly, insulation is the simplest and most cost-effective means to lower this energy use. Remember, sealing and ventilating your home correctly will not only keep you warm in winter but will also cool you down in the summer months… Insulation is the perfect four season solution to saving you money.
If you are working on a “Green Building” project, or consider environmental sustainability a factor in your decision-making when selecting an insulation installer, please contact us. We choose to install Climatizer Plus™ cellulose insulation for its superior thermal and acoustical performance as well as its environmental benefits. Climatizer Plus loose-fill cellulose is certified by UL’s ECOLOGO program; indicating that this product has undergone rigorous scientific testing, auditing, or both, to prove its compliance with stringent, third party, environmental performance standards and may help you contribute to LEED credit categories.   
Call us or “Get started today” on our website and allow us to provide you the information you need to make an informed choice for your home or building insulation needs.  We offer free in-home assessments and quotes.

OUR SERVICES
Attic Insulation
Cellulose insulation is composed from treated wood- or paper-based product. It is mechanically spray blown into open spaces of the house or commercial building to slow down the transmission of heat or cold.

Home Insulation
All year round, insulation maintains a comfortable temperature in our homes, keeping them safe from the cold of winter and the heat of summer. When a house is insulated correctly, it requires very little additional heating and is very energy efficient.

Soundproofing
Just as a building can be insulated for heat, it can also be insulated for sound because it is an excellent way to minimize noise pollution. A complete soundproofing system includes floors, ceilings, and walls for optimal acoustic comfort.

Thermal Home Inspection
Insulation is a thermal transmitter blocker of heat or cold, preventing thermal energy from passing through. That is why we offer thermal imaging home inspections to see precisely where your home is losing heat. No more guessing games; know your home's specific needs.

At Warm Cozy Cozy, we provide insulation removal in certain circumstances. We will provide this service if the following apply:
- When there is a leaky roof, mould will grow.
- Water-damaged insulation will no longer insulate your home.
- Animal infestation leads to unsanitary insulation caused by urine and feces.
- Wires chewed by the animals pose a fire hazard.
- Old insulation no longer insulates your home as it has a lifespan.
- When your old insulation is dirty and causing a bad smell in your home.",warm-cozy-cozy,2021-04-12T10:40:57.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,"Cellulose insulation and fibreglass Insulation, Mould Spray, Soffits, Baffles, Roof Ventilators

Our business has grown because of our many customer referrals. At Let It Rain the quality of our work does the advertising for us. Our goal is to provide you with the most durable and energy efficient roof system by providing the best quality roofing in Toronto, Mississauga, Etobicoke and the Greater Toronto Area.  

Commitment To Quality:
Let It Rain is committed to continual research and development for all aspects of your metal, sloped or flat roof system. This includes shingles, ventilation and insulation. It is this unyielding commitment to quality that allows us to create the most durable and energy efficient roof for your home. We use custom parts and always make custom calculations to determine how we can maximize the life of your complete roof system. At Let It Rain we take pride in knowing that you are as comfortable under your roof as we are under ours. 

SERVICES INCLUDE:

Shingle Roofing:
Let It Rain installs a wide range of roofing shingles, including cedar, slate and fiberglass asphalt shingles. Let It Rain can replace your roof beautifully and ensure that it's guaranteed for life.

Roof Insulation & Attic Upgrades:
Installing a new roof is only as reliable as the insulation and attic underneath it. Let It Rain can not only replace your roof, but can make sure that it lasts a lifetime.

Aluminum:
To complement your roof installation, Let It Rain Roofing also installs aluminum siding, soffit, fascia, eavestrough and downpipes.

Flat Roofing:
Let It Rain offers flat roof installations and roof replacements for residential and commercial flat roofs.

Repair and Construction:
As a full service roofing contractor, Let it Rain offers roof maintenance and emergency roof repair in Mississauga, Toronto and the GTA.

Downspout Disconnection:
The city of Toronto’s Downspout Disconnection bylaw is now in effect. All Toronto homes must now disconnect downspouts from the city’s sewer system. See how Let it Rain can help you disconnect your downspouts. ",let-it-rain-inc,2008-03-04T16:55:15.000-05:00,NA,,,,"Shingle Roof:
At Let It Rain, we install a wide range of roofing shingles, including cedar, slate and fiberglass asphalt shingles. In addition to protecting your roof, our shingles can also improve the aesthetic value of your home because we offer a wide range of shingle colours and profile options.
Insulation & Attic Upgrades

Attic or ceiling insulation and roof ventilation are often ignored but have a large impact on the comfort of your home and the life of your roof. Without proper attic insulation and balanced ventilation, your attic will allow heat to escape, creating damaging moisture and ice build up. Let It Rain knows that attic insulation is an important part of the roof system. With a reliable and functional attic, Let It Rain ensures that your roof installation lasts a lifetime.
Aluminum

Let It Rain’s Aluminum Department offers a range of products and services to enhance the look of your home and protect it from the elements. Our suppliers provide aluminum for eavestrough, soffit and fascia in an array of colours to compliment your existing colour scheme.
Flat Roofing

Let It Rain installs flat roofs for both residential and commercial applications in Toronto, Mississauga, Oakville, Brampton and all communities in the GTA.
Let It Rain’s Production Manager, Peter Dann, has over 30 years experience in the commercial and residential fields and our professional and courteous crews deliver the highest quality installations of flat roofing. 
Roof Repairs and Construction

Regular maintenance of your roof can extend its life and prevent costly interior damage. Let It Rain’s Repair and Construction department will assist you in resolving a range of roofing related problems on both shingled and flat roofs. Our service extends throughout Mississauga, Toronto and around GTA.

Mandatory Downspout Disconnection

The city of Toronto’s Downspout Disconnection bylaw is now in effect. All Toronto homes must now disconnect downspouts from the city’s sewer system.
",,"What you need to know:

The Roofing System consists of three components that should be balanced to work efficiently.

    The Shingled Roof acts as an umbrella shedding water and snow off the building.
    Insulation separates the attic from the house interior creating a comfortable home environment and reducing energy consumption.
    Ventilation moves cool air into the attic and hot air out. It extends the life of the shingles and provides a comfortable living environment",NA,NA,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,TRUE,FALSE,,1693118,"Let It Rain, Ltd.",103,80,21,8.775,"Roofing, Roofing Contractor, Metal Roofing, Roofing Material, Roofing Shingles, Roofing Company, cedar roofing, roofing repair, roof repair, cedar shingles, shingles, roof repair, slate roofing, slate roofs, cedar shakes, roof, how to roof, about roofing, at roofing, the roofing, roofing roofing, a roofing, roof roof roofing, shingles, roofs, shingles for roof, roof shingles, shingles roof, roofing shingles, shingles roofing, metal roof, roof metal, metal roofing, roofing metal, steel roof, steel roofing, roof repair, roof and repair, roofers, roofer, roof tiles, roof tile, tile roof, roofing contractors, roofing companies, metal roofs, roof shingle, shingle roof, contractor roofing, roofing contractor, Roofing Contractor for New Shingles, roofing canada, roofing companies, canadian roofing contractors, roof builders, roofing installers, contractor roofing, roofing calgary, roofing ottawa, roofers calgary, roofing jobs, roofing barrie, best roofing material, vancouver, roofing contractors, roof contractors, roofing supply , home roofing, roofing ontario, roof ontario, commercial roofing, residential roofers, roofing builders, shingle roof contractor, residential roofing company, roof types, best roofing company, fiberglass shingles,  canadian roofing company, flat roofing, industrail roofing, types of roofing, roofing options, list roofing companies, shinglers, roofing estimates, elk shingles,  roofing reviews, asphalt shingles prices, metal sheet roofing, roofing systems, flat roofing companies, roofing and siding, roofers review, new roofing, slate roofing contractors, roof installers, vinyl roofing material, roof sheets, commercial roof repairs,Insulation, Home Insulation, Foam Insulation, Thermal Insulation, Fiberglass Insulation, cellulose insulation, insullation, celulose insulation, sprayfoam insulation, spray foam, what is insulation, insulating, insulated, insulate, insulator, save energy, insulators, foam insulation, insulation foam, foam spray, insulating foam, wall insulation, energy savers, radiant heat, sound insulation, spray in insulation, insulation spray in, insulation spray, spray on insulation, spray insulation, owenscorning, board insulation, insulation board, insulation home, insulation for the home, home insulation, loft insulation, foam insulation spray, insulation foam spray, spray insulation foam, spray on foam insulation, spray in foam insulation, insulation spray foam, spray foam insulation, foam spray insulation, insulation for attic, insulation in attic, attic insulation, insulation attic, insulating board, insulating foam spray, insulating spray foam, house insulation, insulation for house, insulation house, sprayfoam insulation, insulated panels, insulating home, soundproofing,Insulation, ,",1,2009-06-09T04:53:44.000-04:00,letitrain,FALSE,0,0,24,NA,FALSE,254e1fce270e7ae1ebc84726934d3b8afbde0101,TRUE,2022-01-20T14:40:12.000-05:00,TRUE,TRUE,1643270,89.1615382181,386,NA,NA
