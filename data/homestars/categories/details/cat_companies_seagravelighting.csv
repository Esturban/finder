Envirotech Insulation specializes in installing cellulose in walls, cavities, knee walls, garage ceilings, attics, and other area that might be inaccessible without having to remove plaster, or drywall.  Through infrared we can identify problem areas of air leakage, and missing or lack of insulation to help suggest the proper recommendations for increasing the energy efficiency and comfort in your home.

Whatever your outdoor lighting needs, we have the experience and expertise to get it done right the first time.

WHAT WE DO:

We want to transform your outdoor living spaces in the best way possible. Some of our exquisite outdoor lighting options include:

-Accent lighting to subtly show off your property’s best features
-Architectural lighting to highlight your home’s unique beauty
-Pool lighting to keep your nightly swims safe

Call us today for a free at-home consultation, and one of our lighting designers will make a customs lighting design for your unique property.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:

We are dedicated outdoor lighting designers and installers. We do one thing, and we do it the best. We aren't a sprinkler company or lawn care company moonlighting in outdoor lights when times are slow. We will be here to take the call when your lights need maintenance years down the road.

We manufacture our lights by hand, mostly in the United States but some right here in Toronto, so we can control the entire chain of quality from raw materials to your beautiful garden. 

Our designers, installers, and service crews are all our own staff: we do not use sub-contractors. With Outdoor Lighting Perspectives, your satisfaction is guaranteed in writing and backed by our 30 year on-site warranty.

THE TRUSTWORTHY CHOICE:

How can you find an outdoor lighting contractor you can trust to get the work done right, on time, and safely? 

We have been independently vetted by a third-party for our complete and up-to-date liability insurance and workers compensation coverage, our safety and training compliance, and our long established track record of happy customer referrals and testimonials. 

Companies claiming to do lighting come and go, but we're celebrating 20 years and our warranty is backed by our international network of 60+ locations. We'll install your lights today, but we'll also maintain them for years to come.

THE NEXT STEP:

We offer free design consultations and free quotes. Please contact us to discuss your outdoor lighting needs and how we can be of assistance.
