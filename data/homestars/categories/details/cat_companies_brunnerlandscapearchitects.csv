My name is John Griffin, and I have been in the Landscape Industry for approximately twenty (20) years.  My goal with this small business is to build long term relationships with people, and provide common sense, economical, professional landscape design services. I am a full member with seal of the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects. I perform professional landscape design services for a wide range of clients needs, from the simplest of projects up to multi-year phased Master Plans. My business is focused largely on the residential sector, however, I will take on commercial, industrial and Municipal projects. I provide design services only, I do not provide construction, however, with over 15 years of construction experience I can provide construction advice. (I.e., the hiring of contractors, financial strategies, contract documents, phasing plans, cost estimates, schedule of quantities, etc.)
