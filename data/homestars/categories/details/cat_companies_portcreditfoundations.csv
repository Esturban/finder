Quality. Integrity. Value.
 

The Inside Guys are a full-service basement improvement company, with an emphasis on basement lowering, waterproofing and underpinning. Having worked in the industry for the past 26 years, on over 250 projects within the GTA for various construction companies, we noticed that there was something missing with some of these bigger companies: the communication and professionalism was lacking on many jobsites.

We decided to model our company based on higher ethical standards combined with superior craftsmanship. We realize that we are only as good as our last job and future work success is dependent on our reputation. We not only want to exceed your expectations for the work but also how smooth the project runs so we pride ourselves on being there from the day one until itâ€™s done.
We care about what we build for you.


WE DO ALL THE WORK.



We work with every client, one-on-one from start to finish. We promise to not only quote the work, but to also do the work.

This is something unique in our industry â€“ we want to bring back accountability to the jobsite and ensure homeowners are treated with knowledge and respect.

From the moment we take on your project, your peace of mind is our main priority. We want a clear and transparent process, with on-going communication and continuous support so you can be assured the job will get done right the first time.


We will not only promise to do all of the day to day work but we will also act as project supervisors and ensure that each project is constructed to plan with no variations. We will deal with the City of Toronto Inspectors directly so that no communication is lost if there are ever any discrepancies.
If you have any questions at the end of the day we will provide you with pictures of the dayâ€™s work and let you know what the next steps will be.


At the end of the day, it comes down to trust. We feel that we must earn it.

At the end of each job you will receive a folder that includes the original drawings, locates, inspection reports and a zip drive of images for your peace of mind.
