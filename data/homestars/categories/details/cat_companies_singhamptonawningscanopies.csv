We began operating in April of 1992 after buying assets from Wrisco Ltd. Wrisco was a major supplier of aluminum patio covers, enclosure material and awnings for over 30 years. For 17 years we operated from the old Wrisco location, a 32,000 square foot facility in the Toronto suburb of Markham. In February of 2009, we moved to our current custom designed, 40,000 square foot facility in Ajax, Ontario (just East of Toronto).

Craft-Bilt’s main business is contractor sales of sunrooms, railing, waterproof decking, awnings and patio covers. We manufacture railing kits, canopy kits and sunroom kits. Our line of retractable fabric shades includes: fabric awnings, motorized screens, free standing canopies and canopies for pergolas.

We take a great deal of pride in the engineering behind our products. Proper engineering is important for obtaining building permits. You will find that Craft-Bilt products exceed the industry standard.

Our sales are primarily to customers in Canada. If you are interested in sunrooms or shade products in the USA, please contact Craft-Bilt Manufacturing Co. in Pennsylvania. They have been producing sunrooms in the United States for over 40 years.

With over 25 years of building and construction experience serving Southwestern Ontario Awning Authority focuses on providing elegant shade solutions that enhance your backyard living and extend the time spent enjoying the outdoors. Our countless satisfied customers speak to our dedication and commitment to quality work.

Retractable Patio Awnings
Increase the comfort of your backyard, patio or deck with an attractive and stylish retractable patio awning. At Awning Authority we help you find solutions for your patio - protect yourself, your patio and outdoor furniture from the heat and the harmful UV rays on those hot summer days. 

Awnings, or overhangs, are a secondary covering attached to the exterior of a building. They are typically made of woven canvas, often with laminated vinyl layers or other protective treatments, and stretched over a strong or rigid structure for support. Awnings, in various formats, have been around centuries, offering protection against sun, rain, and wind, and helping make indoor and outdoor spaces more comfortable for everyone. They can be an attractive and useful addition to your home, protecting it and increasing its value.


BENEFITS OF RETRACTABLE AWNINGS AND SHADE PRODUCTS

ADD BEAUTY AND COMFORT
Awnings can be made from a very wide variety of fabrics with many patterns and colours available to match all styles and tastes. Superior stain resistant fabrics allow for a simple clean. A quality metal housing protects the fabric from weather and birds from nesting.

A NATURAL AIR CONDITIONER
On the hottest summer days, many households run air conditioning around the clock, incurring high electricity bills and generating greenhouse gases. However, blocking sunlight using awnings, particularly at southern and western exposures, can help reduce temperatures on the patio by as much as 12 degrees Celsius, and by 8 degrees indoors

ULTIMATE PROTECTION
Along with increasing the comfort of your backyard patio or deck a retractable shade product can protect you and your furniture from harmful UV rays. It will considerably extend the longevity of your furniture and decor, prevent colours from fading, and fabrics from disintegrating.

CONVENIENCE WITH A WARRANTY
A retractable awning can cover up to 7 meters (23 feet) along the wall and project out as far as 4 meters (13 feet) – enough to cover even the largest patios or terraces. Add a motorized unit for push-button convenience. Plus, we offer full customization! Contact us today with your requirements and we will help you find a solution. We are backed by a 5 year warranty, all of our patio awnings are made in Canada and engineered for durability and quality.",awning-authority,2021-04-29T11:29:18.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,Supply and install retractable shade covers with self supporting or free standing options.
