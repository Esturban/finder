Bee’s Knees Plumbing and Heating, Ltd. began as the dream of our two Founders, Kevin and Sylvana, and first opened its doors in August of 2019. The “bee’s knees” is 1920s slang that in the most basic terms means something is very nice, very good, the best, the latest, the greatest, or simply excellent. Where the term bee’s knees originated from is up for debate. Some believe that it is related to the fact that when bees go from flower to flower, some of the nectar, or sweet goodness, winds up sticking to their knees. Others contend that the term stems from the expression “be all and end all” because a shortened version of the phrase is “B’s and E’s,” which sounds like bee’s knees. To us, the phrase represents joy, quality, and care, and we want our customers to feel like we’re the bee’s knees to them as their trusted service providers.

Our Team is the Bee’s Knees!
Our hive is currently made up of fourteen team members, and we all pride ourselves on providing high-quality workmanship paired with excellent customer service.

As an added bonus, all of us at Bee’s Knees are big fans of dogs, so you can be confident your pup will be spoiled with belly rubs while we are there, and we are always sure to close the gate behind us to keep your pups safe.
