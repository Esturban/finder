We specialize in residential asphalt shingle re-roofing and are certified CertainTeed ShingleMasters. Trevor is the son of Brian and Dorothy McDonald, who  successfully owned and operated McDonald’s Flooring in Maple Ridge for over 40 years. After taking several business and marketing classes in college, and then learning the trade over six years, Trevor decided to operate his own roofing company. Beginning as a modest residential re-roofing and repairing business, Ridge Meadows Roofing has grown into a full-fledged team of skilled professionals, who consistently provide great service and demonstrate their workmanship on each and every roof. But even with a talented team of roofing professionals, Trevor carefully oversees all tasks.
 
We service the following areas and beyond; Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam, Port Moody, Langley, Surrey, Burnaby and Vancouver.

Fraser (Director of Operations) 
Clients are always excited to see Fraser’s evident knowledge and passion – a result of his range of experience, commitment, and drive. Born and raised in the lower mainland, Fraser has been in construction for almost two decades. Believing in a lead-by-example approach, Fraser thoroughly enjoys being on site with the crew – to offer this experience and pass it on. He is involved in every step of the process to turn your dreams into a reality, which keeps him busy! In his time out of work, Fraser enjoys keeping fit, with a history in martial arts, and is helped along by running after his small collection of dogs and cats. 

Katie (Director of Design)
Black Belt’s darling – Katie – joined the Black Belt team over a decade ago and her precision, attention to detail and energy all combined to lead to the fruition of Katie’s main joy: her tiling. From intricate designs, to pristine execution, clients are astounded with what Katie delivers. After pouring her love into her work, Katie manages to find some more for her sporting life, where she also coaches. She credits her work ethic to her father, grandfather and other family members, whom she enjoys spending her free time with.
