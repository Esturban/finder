WHY IMPERIAL SEALING
A proper maintenance program can assure that your investment remains looking like new. Things like ultraviolet radiation can age an unprotected surface, and If that doesn’t do it then leave it to the vehicles that track road salt onto driveways and parking lots to add to the problem. Along with other common things like oil, anti-freeze, bird droppings, efflorescence stains, moss, weeds, and insects. Let the professionals at Imperial Sealing save you the time and aggravation and help out and recommend the perfect maintenance package tailored to your budget.
.
.
OUR SERVICES:
STAMPED CONCRETE
We use different repair techniques to address different problems, with some cracks we can make them virtually disappear, Pitting is another common problem that we fix, deicing materials from the road will penetrate the concrete on warm winter days and then freeze when the temperature falls, leaving holes or “pits” in your concrete. by using special techniques we can repair that damage and restore the concrete.

Do you have a problem with the colour of your concrete?? Lets us restore the colour and help protect it. We can add colour to our coatings to manipulate the look of the concrete, this can be useful in situations where the concrete did not match from when it was poured, and you would like to improve it!
