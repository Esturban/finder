We work extensively with municipalities thoughout the GTA and surrounding area where we submit approximately 100- 120 permit application annually. Our client building permit needs are meet with our end to end service starting with an initial virtual consultation where we discuss the renovation goals, planning challenges, design solutions and schedule site visit. On our site visit we capture all site conditions with a 3D laser scanner. Once the site data is processed and the existing 3D model developed, we conduct a virtual 3D walkthrough design discussion of the design for client comments and approval. The next steps is permit production which involves BIM and Engineer team. Then the permit drawing set is turned over to our Permit Expeditor to ensure the most efficient permit review and approval regardless of the municipality. This is our ""done for you"" process that delivers the result every time. In the event there is a minor variance, conservation authority, or site plan control application required to advance the construction permit, our team is well equipped and experience working through these processes.",property-pathways-inc,2022-07-14T14:58:18.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,"Secondary Suite, Multi Unit Conversion, Single Family Renovation, Deck Design, 3D model","Architectural Design, Building Permit, Scan to BIM, 3D laser scanning, ",,,2017,5,Email Interac,"Architectural Technologist, Construction Management",BCIN,,TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,FALSE,,2032450,Property Pathways Inc.,8,7,28,10,"Architects, Architectural Consultants, Residential Architects, Architect, structural, engineer, architects, landscape architects, architect design, design architect, architectural design, architect landscape, landscape architect, designer architect, architect designer, 3d architect, home architect, architect home, architecture firm, architect firm, construction architect, architect studio, ,",0,2022-07-14T15:07:11.000-04:00,,FALSE,0,0,41,0,FALSE,eb22c0e3cbd945578754712a29d1ca7ac7ca1772,TRUE,2022-08-05T21:24:22.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2285864,88.5994215073,309,NA,NA
