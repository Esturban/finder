Pruning - Often, trees are pruned for building, pedestrian, sidewalk, and utility wire clearance. Other times they are pruned for in order to improve the structure of the tree and reduce the risk of future failures. When pruned properly, trees will maintenance free for several years. Topping is not an advisable form of pruning as they will cause damage and hinder future growth and possibly create a hazardous tree later on, also increasing the cost of future maintenance.

Removal - When ​trees are diseased, badly damaged or otherwise in decline they can pose a safety hazard to your family and surrounding neighbours, structures, fences and other landscape features. We can help you make an informed decision on whether or not to retain or remove a tree.
 
Cabling - Cabling is a form of preventative maintenance for trees to help add strength to flaws in the structure and reduce the risk of future failures during severe weather. We can help you decide which method of cabling is suitable for your trees.
 
Tree Planting - Spring and summer is the best time to plant trees. Especially during cooler spring months that offer plenty of rain. Careful consideration of placement and which species of tree are areas that we would love to help you with. Young, newly transplanted trees should get lots of water at regular intervals.
 
Stump ​Grinding - ​Removal of old and new stumps for future landscaping is recommended.
