Joel and Rob were both participating in an electrical golf tournament and were paired together. After getting to know each other over a couple drives, putts and pints, they realized that they were virtually neighbours. 

They began a friendship bonding over many more rounds of golf as well as other sports like dodgeball. Eventually they began working together at the same electrical company, and were coworkers for several years. 

Joel and Rob had discussed how it was their dream to become entrepreneurs and business owners one day. They believed that their skill sets were complementary and could be the beginning of something great if they took the leap of faith.

In May 2016, they finally opened up the electrical contracting company of their dreams, Floodlight Electric. Fast forward to today, and Floodlight Electric has quickly solidified themselves into the residential, commercial and government markets in Ottawa with a growing team.

Floodlight Electric was founded to enhance the customer experience with electricians. The company was built on the foundation of trust, honesty and professionalism. Floodlight Electric has provided reliable electrical services to thousands of home owners and businesses in Ottawa, ON. The entire team of electricians are seasoned industry professionals that are licensed to perform electrical services in accordance to code and regulations.",floodlight-electric-inc,2017-03-24T12:09:16.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,,,,NA,NA,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,,1957773,Floodlight Electric Inc.,7,6,1,10,"Electricians, Residential Electricians, Electrical Contractors, Electrical Wiring, knob and tube contractors, electrician, which electrician, electrical companies, electrical work, electrical contractors, jobs electrician, electrical contractor, electrical services, electric contractors, electric contractor, generator, generators, ,",0,2022-06-01T14:54:07.000-04:00,FALSE,0,0,2,0,FALSE,1c5dbe1d0da29defa5e32f5d5e16efa12eea41cd,TRUE,2018-06-11T10:33:39.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2282104,90.2520936107,348,NA,NA,floodlight
