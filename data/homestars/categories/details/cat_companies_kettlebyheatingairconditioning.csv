Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

The technology was developed within the Indoor Environment Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose IAQ scientists tested it. The research was funded by US Environmental protection agency, US dept. of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and California Institute of Energy and Environment.

",infiniti-air-conditioning-heating-newmarket,2019-02-26T22:39:25.000-05:00,NA,NA,NA,,"MODULATING HIGH-EFFICIENCY FURNACE:

Is like highway driving, making slight operating adjustments while achieving maximum efficiency. This new condensing furnace with a modulating gas valve operates with more finesse to reduce temperature fluctuations, providing consistent indoor temperature, quiet operation, and an annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) of 97.4%.

​TWO STAGE HIGH EFFICIENCY FURNACE:

Unlike traditional furnaces that turn on and run at full capacity with each demand for heating. Two-stage furnaces start out by running in its first stage, which uses only about 68% of its capacity. This reduced capacity is sufficient enough to warm your home on those mild winter days. When the temperature outside drops, the furnace will meet the extra demand by adjusting to the second stage heating cycle.

Variable speed brushless DC motors:

Have intelligent technology that monitor incoming data from the blower and adjust accordingly so you can feel confident that your system is working to keep you comfortable. A DC motor uses substantially less electricity to move the same amount of air.

​ HIGH-EFFICIENCY NATURAL GAS FURNACES:

Also known as a condensing furnace, is the most efficient furnace available, because it provides your home with ideal heating comfort while using less energy than other models. High-efficiency furnaces are designed to extract additional heat from natural gas and, when they do, the flue gases condense, or turn to water - hence, the name condensing furnace.

​ CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONERS:

The efficiency of air conditioners is often rated by the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating of a unit, the more energy efficient it is.

Air conditioners with 14.5 seer rating and higher are eligible to receive government rebates.

​ FIREPLACES:

Either they are direct vent or inserts. Direct vent fireplaces are designed to be vented directly out the outside wall.

Inset fireplaces are designed to be inserted into an existing wood burning fireplace. A chimney liner is required to be installed with an insert fireplace.

HEAT RECOVERY VENTILATOR (HRV):

Can help make mechanical ventilation more cost effective by reclaiming energy from exhaust airflows. HRVs use heat exchangers to heat or cool incoming fresh air, recapturing 60 to 80 percent of the conditioned temperatures that would otherwise be lost.

​ TANKLESS WATER HEATER:

Tankless water heaters were once the wave of the future, but now they are gaining in popularity every day as homeowners and business owners alike discover the benefits of instant water heating technology. Takagi is a leader in the industry for the best in tankless water heating, and there are many units to choose from. PlumbingSupply.com is your source for Takagi tankless water heaters that are good for your energy budget, and good for the environment!","We are a Primary Carrier Dealer

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA.
