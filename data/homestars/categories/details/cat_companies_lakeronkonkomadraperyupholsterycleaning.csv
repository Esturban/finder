With over 50 years of experience in Stain Prevention or Fabric Protection, Stain Protection Services, Inc. is the industry’s most advanced chemical architecture achieving superior stain resistance. Our group has achieved advanced, non-toxic environmentally friendly (safe for children and animals) Stain Protection, and Prevention, and Area Rug Cleaning - specializing in ecologically friendly cleaning methods. While initially known as ""Scotchguarding"", Stain Prevention/Fabric Protection has evolved into an industry that protects fabrics, and fibers from spots, and stains at a level that has not previously been seen. As the industry has evolved, the group at Stain Prevention Services has become the gold standard for Stain Prevention, and Fabric Protection. We also specialize in Area Rug cleaning - we wash, disinfect, and deodorizing Rugs while removing many different types of spots, and stains. Rug/Carpet colour correction/repair, Upholstery & Furniture cleaning are also additional areas of our specialization. 


Stain Protection Services also specializes in cleaning the finest Persian, Nepalese, Turkish, Pak Persian, and Oriental Rugs. The company offers everything from a seasonal light cleaning, to a full Deep Extraction cleaning including heavy-duty restorative challenges. 
Stain Protection Services uses multiple cleaning methods such as dry foam, absorbent compound, Low Moisture Cleaning, Bonnet Cleaning, Dry Cleaning and several extractive cleaning methods can be used on any item we clean. We custom tailor our cleaning methods to suit your furnishing’s specialized needs.
We also do Fire Retarding on practically ANY material or fiber.

WHY OUR PROTECTOR IS DIFFERENT
Protecting your fine furnishings is critical to ensuring their just purchased appearance lasts for as long as possible.  Many of the big-brand protectors you may already be familiar with work pretty well most of time, but will only bead up a spill for about 10 – 15 minutes before allowing it to seep through the protective barrier, and cause a stain.  Some fiber types don’t absorb or accept protector well, and these types of protectors can dissipate, or wear away with spot cleaning, or worn thin in high traffic areas. 
Our high tech Protection uses a non-aqueous formula based on nanoscience for maximum penetration of the protector into the fibers at the molecular level of the furnishing. Many companies employ a WATER-based solution which becomes problematic when treating fibers that are susceptible to colour shift or dye bleed, as water-based protectors are known to occasionally cause dye damage while solvent-based protectors do not.
We at Stain Protection Services believe in a proactive approach to Fabric care, rather than reactive - we have developed and perfected a different kind of Stain Protection to protect your fine furnishings.

DESTRUCTION OF DYES
This occurs when a retail stain remover (Oxyclean, Resolve, or stain removers of this type), has removed colour from fabric.  The harsh chemicals in these stain removers can create a bleaching, or halo effect that leaves behind a much lighter colour after use.

MASKING OF DYES
This type of stain occurs when one dye/spill is dark, or deep enough in colour to cover up the existing dyes, such as when a red sports drink spills, and permanently colours beige fibers red.
RECOMBINATION STAIN
This happens when the existing dyes and the newly introduced stain colour combine to make a new colour, such as when a pink coloured area rug takes on yellow pet urine, but the final stain appears orange.
Our product works at a molecular level protecting your fine furnishings by actually penetrating the fibers, and filling up the millions of dye-receptor sites with protector, leaving virtually no room for foreign matter to deposit, no matter the fiber type: silk, wool, nylon, or viscose. Our product is so advanced that it can withstand deep cleanings, and still remain effective after the cleaning.  Additionally,  our Protection will never affect the colour, or texture of your fine furnishings.

PET ACCIDENTS
If you own a pet, accidents are inevitable. When a stain is cleaned up, residue, and damage to the rug's colour, and fibers can remain - this often becomes a  health concern.  Bacteria, molds, and fungi thrive in pet accidents.
Over time, you'll begin to detect a foul odor, and a corresponding bacterial colony ensues which is unhealthy, and disgusting!  Pet urine is initially deposited in an acid state.  As the urine dries, it becomes increasingly alkaline.  This PH shift often loosens the dye bonds in rug fibers. It's these repeated pet urine deposits which are the primary cause of mold, often creating dry rot. The dry rot leads to weakened fibers that break, wreaking havoc on your beautiful rug.
While it's highly unlikely we will ever be able to prevent these pet accidents from happening, we can be proactive by protecting your rug, or upholstery fibers.  StainProtect helps keep the urine on the surface of the fabric for much easier removal.  With less penetration of the fibers, the bacterial colony is limited in its food supply causing the colony to dissipate, and eventually disappear.  
Protect your investment in rugs and other furnishings by keeping them looking great and long-lasting with StainProtect!

Why is Carpet Cleaning so important?

It helps to remove dust mites, bacteria and other allergens, which ultimately helps your family breathe easier and reduces the risk of colds and other health problems!

Why is Tile and Grout Cleaning important?

Because without regular professional cleaning, the grout in between tiles will start to look black and dirty. Not only does this look bad, but it can also harbor bacteria that could give off offensive odors or even make you sick.
