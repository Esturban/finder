We worked long and hard to build our company and in doing so we came to appreciate the importance of having deep roots and a strong foundation. We are proud of our company and therefore decided to continue our company rather than shut down and start again. With the full support of the Alberta and Newfoundland Registrars, the company was relocated. We now operate our company “Northfield Builders Inc” from our home town of Happy Valley Goose Bay, NL. 
The foundation for this company was built with integrity, honesty with a focus on quality. We continue to build where we left off in Alberta. 

We carry full liability insurance and we are in good standing with WHSCC in Newfoundland.

We recognize that there is a fine line between being confident and in being arrogant and we are careful not to cross the line. We seek to present ourselves always in a positive light with a can-do attitude. We remain open always to learning and upgrading our skillsets. The door to learning never closes.

We believe that our clients are of utmost importance and other aspects of the project supersede the pricing for any successful project.
