COOLING
At Belyea Bros. we install and service a range of air conditioning systems including forced air (central) air conditioning, ductless split air conditioners, and our custom designed Attic Pak and SpacePak systems. Due to our background as a hot water heating specialists we are experts at planning and executing cooling solutions for houses without ductwork.

HEATING
At Belyea Bros. Limited we hold the first heating license issued in Toronto. As a result, we have the experience to claim, “there is nothing about heating we don’t know”. We are experts in hot water, radiant in-floor, snow melt systems and forced air heating. Over a number of years we have carefully selected the products that we recommend to our customers. We sell only manufacturers that have a proven track record of quality and service so that we can offer you the best support possible. All the manufacturers we work with have parts centers or distributors within the GTA meaning we have access to a local support network. We offer only reliable premium equipment.

HOT WATER TANKS 
Water heater rentals are a great solution for many homeowners who have a short-to-medium time frame in their house, own a tenanted property, are looking for a peace-of-mind solution to address their domestic hot water needs, or simply wish to have a clear idea of their monthly house budget over the long term without the worry of heater repairs.

Many consumers are confused by which company they actually rent their water heater from, thinking that because the charge appears on their gas bill that they rent from “gas-company”. In fact, most customers in Toronto rent their heaters from Centrica PLC, an international energy services company based in the United Kingdom, which operates in Canada under the brand name Direct Energy™. Although they bill on the gas bill, they are not, in any way, affiliated with your gas utility.

Belyea Bros. has a wide range of hot water tank solutions for your family’s needs. We have an excellent rental program providing a comparable rate and great reliable products. We provide a fix rate increase, unlike the other guys who may raise your billing at anytime. 

TANKLESS HOT WATER
Tankless hot water heaters are common in Europe and Japan. They can supply an endless supply of hot water, with greater energy savings than conventional tanks. They are, however, limited in the amount of hot water that can be produced at one time and the upfront costs are higher.

ELECTRICAL SERVICE
Belyea Bros. Electrical specializes in helping home and business owners in the older neighborhoods of Toronto. We provide electrical service, repair and installation whether it’s diagnosing and fixing a broken outlet, or re-wiring your whole home, Belyea Bros. Electrical is here to help.

Our History
Grant and Greg owe their business prowess to their grandfather, Tom Rodman, who perfected his skills in the sheet metal trade while working at the General Motor's plant in Oshawa before founding his own business, Rodman Sheet Metal, in 1949, during a time when sheet metal fittings were still produced by hand. Tom and his staff are responsible for the installation of hundreds of oil furnaces and duct systems in homes that were built across Ajax, Pickering, Whitby and Oshawa during the 1950s and 60s. Rodman Sheet Metal was eventually renamed to Rodman Heating.
In 1972, Greg and Grant's father, Ron Dainty, a certified Tool & Die Maker, joined the Rodman Heating team as a sheet metal apprentice. Ron expanded his skill set to include an expertise in oil and natural gas furnaces and central air conditioning. By 1975, Tom was ready to retire his tool belt, and handed the reigns of the business over to Ron. Under Ron's leadership, the company was once again re-branded, this time to reflect their new service offerings – Rodman Heating & Air Condition
Curious as youngsters, Greg and Grant grew up immersed in the family business. During the late 70s, they worked part time as summer students alongside their father.

Our History
Grant and Greg owe their business prowess to their grandfather, Tom Rodman, who perfected his skills in the sheet metal trade while working at the General Motor's plant in Oshawa before founding his own business, Rodman Sheet Metal, in 1949, during a time when sheet metal fittings were still produced by hand. Tom and his staff are responsible for the installation of hundreds of oil furnaces and duct systems in homes that were built across Ajax, Pickering, Whitby and Oshawa during the 1950s and 60s. Rodman Sheet Metal was eventually renamed to Rodman Heating.
In 1972, Greg and Grant's father, Ron Dainty, a certified Tool & Die Maker, joined the Rodman Heating team as a sheet metal apprentice. Ron expanded his skill set to include an expertise in oil and natural gas furnaces and central air conditioning. By 1975, Tom was ready to retire his tool belt, and handed the reigns of the business over to Ron. Under Ron's leadership, the company was once again re-branded, this time to reflect their new service offerings – Rodman Heating & Air Condition
Curious as youngsters, Greg and Grant grew up immersed in the family business. During the late 70s, they worked part time as summer students alongside their father. After graduating from college, the twins both took on full-time roles in family business, taking advantage of hands on learning in every aspect of the heating and cooling business. From the sweat and toil of the sheet metal shop producing custom duct work by hand, to the installing furnaces and air conditioners, to answering the phones and going on late-night service calls, they could do it all.  
When it was Ron's turn to retire and sell the business, Grant and Greg decided to translate their hands-on experience into a successful brand of their own, and so TWINTECH was born.

Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

The technology was developed within the Indoor Environment Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose IAQ scientists tested it. The research was funded by US Environmental protection agency, US dept. of Energy, Electric Power Research Institute and California Institute of Energy and Environment.

The University of California was granted initial patents in 1996 and 1999, and Aeroseal holds an exclusive license to the technology.",aeroseal-tech-inc,2015-01-23T22:44:19.000-05:00,NA,NA,,"Aeroseal, Smart Thermostats and more..","Toronto, GTA, Vaughan, York Region, Richmond Hill, King City, Bolton, Beeton, Aurora, Markham, Uxbridge, Newmarket, Sharon, Bradford, Simcoe County, Barrie, Aliston, Muskoka, Durham Region, Ajax, Pickering, Whitby, Oshawa, Bowmanville, Peterborough, Peel Region, Caledon, Orangeville, Georgetown, Schomberg,Mississauga, Milton, Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, Waterdown, Stoney Creek, Niagara Region, Guelph , Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo and more..","Aeroseal, Pearl Homes",Complete customer service to achieve maximum results.,2004,4,"Credit Cards, Cheque, Cash.",,General Contractor/ Renovator,,TRUE,TRUE,Custom,1,TRUE,FALSE,10 Year Warranty,1927753,Aeroseal Tech Inc.,205,193,43,9.98446,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Solar Panels, Solar Panels, Solar Panel, ,Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating, Solar Water Heating Installation, Heating,",0,aerosealtech,FALSE,0,0,52,0,FALSE,7c5d2bf68480644b0a629f7cfd19af8238a703b4,TRUE,2021-04-01T14:01:21.000-04:00,TRUE,TRUE,2204094,98.076792316,376,NA,NA,NA

Air Purification

The air in your home, for the most part, is the same air being re-circulated over and over again - contaminants included. These contaminants include mold, viruses, pet dander, pollens and household toxins to name a few. There are a variety of options for air purifiers, at all budget levels, that can help you take the next step in a healthier home. LG Home Comfort technicians can guide you through the simplest room solutions right up to whole home air purifiers with hepa filters and UV-C lights. At LG Home Comfort we are confident that we can find an air purification solution for your home.

 

Contact us today to book your air purification installation.

Water Purification

Your homes’ water is an essential part of your everyday life - everything you do in your home requires it! But did you know the quality of your water can also affect the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances? Hard water can cause internal build up of minerals in your washing machine, dishwasher and hot water heater. The level of water purification your home needs depends on the combination of your current water and what outcomes you are looking for.

We offer a full range of water treatment options: softeners, chlorine & iron filters and reverse osmosis units. Allow the LG team to test your water, free of charge, and design a water purification system that gives you the best water possible.

 

Contact us today to book your water purification installation or a complimentary water test.

Whether you require a tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace, let our professional team of technicians evaluate your needs and walk you through your heating options. A poorly designed and installed system can lead to low efficiency and increased operating costs - at LG Home Comfort we take the time to customize each installation to ensure peak performance and efficiency.

───
At A.C.S. we truly do believe that we maintain the highest standard of service and workmanship. 
Every element of our business is designed to deliver optimal results to you, the homeowner. 
From our industry-leading training practices to our comprehensive 120 point inspection, your needs are paramount in everything we do. 


Installation
───
Providing the optimal combination of energy efficiency and comfort our furnaces and air conditioners will save you more money while also doing their part to help the environment.
It doesn’t hurt to consider a furnace with an Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency, also known as a AFUE rating, and an air conditioner with higher SEER ratings. 
A higher rating indicates that the furnace and air conditioner are more energy efficient, will last longer and will save you money. 
But this is only possible if it's installed to A.C.S's high standards.

Duct Cleaning
───

We never cut any corners when it comes to your comfort needs. Discover our commitment to quality with A.C.S.!

Attic Insulation
───
As experts we at A.C.S. agree that the majority of heat loss or gain that takes place in a home is done through its attic. 
This estimated heat loss can be as high as 45% depending on what type of insulation your attic has. 
With an alarming potential for heat loss like that it’s easy to see why you need to pay special attention to how your attic is insulated. 
In winter, when you heat your home that heat rises and your attic insulation is the first line of defense to stop that heat loss and save energy. In summer, hot humid air also penetrates into your attic and makes your home harder to cool. 

Hot Water Heating
───
After home heating, hot water tanks consume the most energy in your home. 
Control your home energy costs by choosing a more energy-efficient hot water tank .
Owning a new Water Tank helps manage cash flow, and comfort! 
Get a Smart Solution for Hot Water Heating. 
Old tanks generally contain build- up and sediment that makes it less efficient and water quality suffers.
