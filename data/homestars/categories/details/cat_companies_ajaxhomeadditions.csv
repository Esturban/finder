WE DON'T SIMPLY BUILD AND RENOVATE, WE CREATE LIVING ART.
Over ten years ago we created our business because we saw a lack of creativity in the market.

Our goal was to shake things up, and unlock the dreams of our clients who wanted to create the home of their dreams, or build a solid investment opportunity.

We have spent years building our world class team of designers, craftsmen and suppliers so that we can offer you, the most incredible bespoke home building experience possible. Our team will work with you every step of the way from pulling permits, to designing the perfect layout with your favorite materials before we even swing the first hammer.

We take into account your requirements, budget, timeline of tasks, size of project, colours, textures, vanities, furnishings that add the final touches and much more to ensure that your house is done to perfection. Your home is dear to you, which makes it dear to us. Put it in the hands of a certified professional renovation contracting company that can effectively handle the scope of any project. Chicasa Design is efficient and diligent with your renovation.

Once you are fully satisfied with your design, our expert craftsmen will do what they do best. The Chicasa team of home builders is second to none, so when we build a home, or perform a renovation, you can be assured that it will last for generations.
