<br />- we also have (6) SIX CVI (Certified Ventilation Inspectors) on staff that can inspect your residential, commercial or industrial HVAC systems.
<br />- NADCA publishes the names of individuals that hold the ASCS designation, make sure your home is being cleaned by a certified and qualified individual; to find out if your technician is certified, please visit: www.nadca.com

A breakdown or necessary replacement of your HVAC or plumbing system can be critical - especially as many of us are still confined to our homes. At AtlasCare we are dedicated to the health and safety of our team members, our customers and our community. That's why we're taking extensive precautions before we enter your home bu disinfecting trucks and tools, washing hands, wearing proper protection equipment, and disinfecting anything we touch. Most of the work we do does not require any interaction with customers - approvals and payments are contactless.

Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology that tackles leaks from the inside out. Aeroseal software allows the technician to accurately measure the duct leakage in residential homes and commercial buildings. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.

Air Purification

The air in your home, for the most part, is the same air being re-circulated over and over again - contaminants included. These contaminants include mold, viruses, pet dander, pollens and household toxins to name a few. There are a variety of options for air purifiers, at all budget levels, that can help you take the next step in a healthier home. LG Home Comfort technicians can guide you through the simplest room solutions right up to whole home air purifiers with hepa filters and UV-C lights. At LG Home Comfort we are confident that we can find an air purification solution for your home.

 

Contact us today to book your air purification installation.

Water Purification

Your homes’ water is an essential part of your everyday life - everything you do in your home requires it! But did you know the quality of your water can also affect the efficiency and lifespan of your appliances? Hard water can cause internal build up of minerals in your washing machine, dishwasher and hot water heater. The level of water purification your home needs depends on the combination of your current water and what outcomes you are looking for.

We offer a full range of water treatment options: softeners, chlorine & iron filters and reverse osmosis units. Allow the LG team to test your water, free of charge, and design a water purification system that gives you the best water possible.

 

Contact us today to book your water purification installation or a complimentary water test.

Heating

Whether you require a tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace, let our professional team of technicians evaluate your needs and walk you through your heating options. A poorly designed and installed system can lead to low efficiency and increased operating costs - at LG Home Comfort we take the time to customize each installation to ensure peak performance and efficiency.

 

Contact us today to book your tune-up, seasonal maintenance or a new furnace appointment.

Cooling

When it comes to cooling, reliability and consistency is key. Every home is unique, which is why our team will take the time to assess your home, your cooling needs and come up with a solution that fits your needs and your budget.

 

Contact us today to book your AC repair, maintenance or installation appointment.

Water

Installing over 1000 water heaters per month, we are experts at heating your home water. Whether you need a simple repair or a new system, our technicians will walk you through the process and explain your different options. Our no-pressure sales guarantee will ensure that you can make a decision in your own time, with all of the information you need.

For new and existing homes we provide the experience, knowledge and friendly customer service to design, install, maintain and repair all types of heating systems. Specialize in hot water heating systems, we work with radiators, gas boilers, hybrid system, tankless water heaters, hydronic radiant heating systems (radiant floors) and solar heating. We also install natural gas furnaces.

At EXTEL Gas services Inc our service and knowledgeable installation technician will explain and help you choose the right air conditioning system to fit your home cooling needs.

We specialize in installing split system air conditioning systems, and ductless air conditioning systems. Call us for your home air conditioning (AC) needs and stay cool in the summer at a low cost.

We also provide HVAC Installation and Maintenance service for small commercial buildings or residential house. For new or existing buildings we can install custom sheet metal ducts that have been designed for your forced air heating and cooling needs, using quality air handlers, and natural gas furnaces that move air effectively and efficiently to maintain a consistent indoor environment for all seasons of the year.

Our company has helped those families during winter blizzards, as well as families on the other end of the spectrum, being stranded without a functioning air conditioner when it’s hot out in Toronto. In either situation, our customers just want the job to be done appropriately in an efficient manner. So, our standards aim to match those needs. We’re available every hour of the day for service calls, we have same-day service options and our technicians are prompt and reliable.

We also know that it’s not always exciting to spend your hard-earned dollars on HVAC, which is why our company works to make it affordable. With in-home cost estimates, you’ll know exactly how much you’re spending and what you’ll receive for that money. Additionally, your energy bills can go down after making sure that your HVAC Systems are as efficient as they can be.

With over 20 years of industry experience, we get the job done right for you the first time. Heatpumps.ca uses only Mitsubishi Electric, fossil-free ductless heating, and cooling systems. Every unit we install conforms to the maximum energy efficiency standards. 

At Heatpumps.ca, we are conscious of the the impact heating and cooling systems have on the environment. Lowering your carbon footprint has never been easier. While reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 is a noble idea, it isn't a simple matter. Home heating is one of the most carbon-intensive industry sectors. That's why heatpumps.ca uses the most energy-efficient equipment available. With standard systems, you lose up to 50% of your heating and cooling through the ductwork. But with our units, you get more comfort at a lower cost, all while using fewer energy resources and improving your indoor air quality. As we say at Heatpumps.ca, ""a greener house is a happier home"". 

We're focused on providing full system installations for our customers throughout Toronto and GTA. Our professional, courteous team members will assist you with every step of the process, ensuring complete satisfaction in our services.

At Radiant Sole, we pride ourselves on our work ethic and the quality of our work. The entire rough-in stage, which consists of insulating the space with R-11 insulation and running grade-A PEX pipes, is typically completed in a single day. With Radiant Sole, you can be certain that you are getting an unparalleled level of quality at a surprisingly affordable price.

We look forward to hearing more about your project. In many cases we can suggest ideas that lead to the most efficient layout, in-turn lowering the overall cost of the system.

Give us a call or send us an email and we'll be in touch right away! Thanks for visiting our page.

More Information about Radiant Sole:

Our team has years of experience designing and installing beautiful hydronic radiant floor heating systems in the GTA. We quickly and efficiently install everything from basement systems to more complex systems including heating of the upper levels of your home. We take great pride in delivering a high quality, beautiful finished product.

Straightforward process:

We use extremely high-quality R-11 insulation and grade-A PEX pipe for the first step of the project, the rough-in. Our insulation doesn’t require messy wire mesh, leaving behind a clean, flat surface ready for the concrete slab. As soon as a heat source is installed, we return to assemble the manifold - the brain behind the system. This is what we call the hookup. You have the option of setting multiple temperature zones with separate thermostats controlling each zone.",radiant-sole-radiant-floor-heating-experts,2015-04-08T12:10:24.000-04:00,NA,NA,,,,,Snowmelting systems and hydronic heating systems,NA,NA,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,TRUE,FALSE,,1931239,Radiant Sole   Radiant Floor Heating Experts,30,27,62,10,"Heating & Air Conditioning, Air Conditioning Installation, Air Conditioning Repair, Heating Oil, Heating System, heat, furnace, a/c, air conditioning, air conditioner, ac air conditioning, air conditioners, furnace, furnaces, airconditioner, lenneox, airconditioning, hvac, what is hvac, air condition, trane, hvac air conditioning, air conditioning hvac, a heating and air, air heating, heating & air, heating and air, heating air, heat pump, air conditioning units, air conditioning unit, unit air conditioning, air conditioner unit, air conditioner units, heating & cooling, heating and cooling, heating cooling, cooling and heating, system heating, heating system, air conditioning cooling, heat and air, heat air, heat & air, air and heat, air conditioning and heating, heating and air conditioning, air conditioning heating, air conditioning & heating, a and a heating and air conditioning, heating air conditioning, heat pumps, airconditioners, systems heating, heating systems, portable air conditioner, cooling system, Furnace Humidifier,  heating and cooling contractors, heat pump installation, home heating, heating ventilation and air conditioning, hvac industry, residential heat pump, heating services, heating contractor, homes heating, central heat, heat sources,  new heating systems, industrial air conditioning, radiant floor heating,  floor heating, central cooling and heating systems, residential heating, heat pump installers,  thermostat, in floor heating, ductless heat pump, programmable thermostat, mini split heat pump, heated floors, hvac systems, hvac technician, what is a heat pump, climate control, what does hvac stand for, electric heating, electric floor heating, new furnace, heat and temperature, h vac, heatpump, hvac design, electric heat, central heating, hvac engineer, home heating systems, hvac supply, thermo stat, heat pumps prices, heat pump efficiency, split heat pump, hvac maintenance, in floor heating cost, electric heat pumps, boiler heating systems, hvac unit, hvac mechanic, hvac repair, commercial hvac, hvac installation, heated tile floor, hvac specialist, hvac services, types of heating systems, hvac tech, air con unit,  air conditioner, canada air conditioner, air condition unit, air conditioning canada, portable air conditioner, room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, portable ac, indoor air conditioner,Floor Laying & Refinishing, Hardwood Floor, Wood Floor, Floor Tile, Dance Floor, Ceramic Floor Tile, Floor Refinishing, bamboo floor, cork floor, FSC wood flooring, stone floor, marble floor, slate floor, squeaky floor repair, laminate, laminate repair, wood floor, floor and wood, wood flooring, wood floors, floors in wood, hardwood flooring, hardwood floors, hardwood floors and, hardwood floor, hardwood floor wood, wood floor flooring, refinishing, floor refinishing, floor refinishing in, refinishing floor, hardwood install, floor laying, laying a floor, flood sanding, wood floor refinishing, refinishing hardwood floors, flooring laying, wood floors refinishing, wood flooring refinishing, floor co, flooring hard wood, hard wood floors, laying floors, flooring company, flooring engineered hardwood, floor company, hard wood floor, cleaning hardwood floors, installing hardwood flooring, installing hardwood floors, installing wood flooring, installing wood floors, installing hardwood floors, installing wood flooring, installing wood floors, installing hardwood floor, hardwood flooring installation, business floor, wood flooring installation, hardwood floor installation, floor companies, lay hardwood flooring, lay hardwood floor, wood floor repair, repair wood floor, repair hardwood floor, hardwood floor repair, finishing a hardwood floor, squeeky floors,,Hardwood floors, Install hardwood floors, caulking,",0,radiantsole,FALSE,0,0,54,0,FALSE,3bc659f856686f2f8fc2ff29bae4f3392feaf2f8,TRUE,2018-01-11T18:53:05.000-05:00,TRUE,TRUE,2025785,79.9367313255,376,NA,NA,NA
