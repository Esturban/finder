A well designed patio is the ultimate versatile living space - a place where you can play, eat, relax, or entertain. Walkways direct foot traffic and provide access throughout your landscape. But they serve several other functions, as well. Walkways can divide up large areas, provide more vantage points for viewing your yard and add the elegance of stone or brick hardscaping.

RETAINING WALLS: Retaining walls let you alter the grade or slope of the land in your yard and are valuable to protect that slope from eroding. Using a retaining wall, we can create level areas that can be used for planting trees, shrubs and gardens or adding a patio - plus many other uses we can get creative with for your yard's needs. A retaining wall doesn't just add function to your yard, it provides an element of beauty and sophistication. 

FIREPITS: Adding a fire pit as part of your landscaping will extend the enjoyment of your backyard for you and your guests. They provide warmth, light, a cooking source, and ambiance, making them a natural gathering spot for socializing, entertaining, and relaxation. A fire pit can also serve as an important focal point in your outdoor landscape design. When placed where it can be easily seen from your interior living space, it can be enjoyed from the indoors as well.

FENCES: By definition, fences define your property line and provide an element of security for your home and yard. A fence also provides privacy when you need to relax and enjoy personal time with friends and family. If needed, you can also use a fence as a way to control the amount of wind and sun you receive in your yard and act as a buffer for reducing neighbourhood noise.

SOD: Your lawn serves as the canvas for the rest of your landscape, forming a framework for garden beds, pathways and patios. It also helps to prevent soil erosion and provides a soft, resilient surface for recreational activities. A lush, green lawn is the perfect way to augment your overall landscape design.
