Our experience and expertise has earned us an excellent reputation for quality and professionalism.

Due to the sheer size of the GTA and the location of our company we have restrictions on how far we can travel. The farther we travel, it only makes sense that we become less competitive and use much more resources from a environmental perspective. Another factor for downtown restrictions is the size of our trucks and trailers and finding suitable, legal parking can be a challenge.  

We service many parts of the GTA including Scaborough and North York. We do not service south of Eglinton from High Park to Victoria Park.

We are a Toronto licensed contractor approved to do work on your home. 

We are not the cheapest but often we are not the most expensive either. We believe we give a proper balance of cost to quality.   We will look at optimizing your eavestrough system in terms of downspout placement and any leaf guard needs. 

We are an Elite installer of Alu-Rex TRex Continuous Fastening System. This allows us to provide you with a 20 year installation warranty on eavestrough installations and a lifetime manufacturer's warranty on new installations with Alu Rex fastening system. 

We have won Best Eavestrough/Gutter Company in Toronto for 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013. 

We have been requested to speak as an Industry Expert at The National Home Show, The Hamilton Ideal Home Show, and The Shopping Channel Network. Darren and team members have appeared on HGTVâ€™s series The Big Flip. Our educational YouTube videos and our informative Blog have 2 million views and we receive comments and questions from all across Canada, USA and even Europe.
