INDOOR AIR QUALITY:
Not to be a killjoy, but are you inside? If so, you most likely be surprised if you realized how many toxins you may have just inhaled, including chemical vapors, microbes, mildew, viruses, bacteria, dust, dirt, pollen, allergens and more. Hold on...what?

The EPA discovered in a survey that Americans spend 87% of their lives inside, and that indoor air pollutant levels are up to 100 times higher than pollution levels found outside. Yikes! Now think about the fact that people breathe an estimated 3,000 gallons of air every single day. So do your kids. So does your Pug. Seriously, we need to stop taking indoor air quality for granted. Not anymore. ",winnipeg-supply-service-experts,2008-03-04T16:55:15.000-05:00,NA,,,,"Furnace Repair Service

You can’t totally prevent your furnace from breaking down, but you can help prevent it with routine furnace maintenance visits. Our in-depth furnace tune-ups and PLUS service plans actually help you save in two ways. First, a well-maintained heating system will operate more efficiently and uses less energy, which helps the environment. Second, proper maintenance means less spending on repairs.

Air Conditioning Maintenance

So you’ve got your thermostat programmed perfectly but you’re still not happy with your energy bill every month?

Solar Air Conditioning

We won’t bombard you with a bunch of “green” terminology, but you should know that solar air conditioning is a lot more realistic and practical than you make think. We have various products that can take your home to the next level of efficiency and also provide your wallet with a little more green as well. While you shouldn’t stare into the sun, you should definitely take a look into taking advantage of all the power it delivers.

When they inquired who did their maintenance, people would respond with stories of duct cleaning scams, poor workmanship, and companies not showing up for scheduled appointments. This was leaving customers to put off their maintenance and which led to costly breakdowns and poor air quality.

What many people do not know about the industry is companies will sell duct cleaning at a loss in order to get inside your home. Their interest is to talk customers into replacing their furnace or air conditioners, not servicing the existing equipment. When these companies do complete the cleaning, they provide a low-quality cleaning without proper cleaning equipment. These shady business practices are what has caused so much misinformation about duct cleaning. Other companies work on commission or false advertising. They advertise a low cost, but after all the fees and extra services the $99 duct cleaning turns to $600 at the final bill. The workers do this because they work strictly on commission.

Taylor and Katie’s solution to these problems was to open a furnace and duct cleaning company that focused on customer service. Their main principle was not to sell a product or provide a service where you would contact them to service your heating and cooling equipment. This would mean they would have to invest in quality equipment, properly train staff, advertise full prices, and good scheduling.

Whyte Ridge Furnace and Air Duct Cleaning was the final solution to this vision. Whyte Ridge has invested in the most powerful duct cleaning equipment in the market. Staff do not work on commission, so they will never offer a service you do not need. Finally, there are never hidden charges or fees for completing a service. All extra services will be asked to be completed by the customer first and explained so they understand what they are paying for. You will understand why Whyte Ridge Furnace and Air Duct Cleaning is 5-Star rated on Google and A rating on BBB!
