The 5,000 sq. ft. showroom of R.E. MacDonald Stoves & Stones has been located at the corner of 248th and the Fraser Highway for over 40 years. The warm and rambling premises is home to a dedicated group of sales and service specialists who remain committed to maintaining one of the highest levels of service in the industry.

Ralph MacDonald opened the store in this same location and we have operated here ever since. To keep up with current trends, the showroom display is ever evolving, however the quaint building looks much the same as it did 40 years ago when it was the local gathering spot – the community centre. Over these 40 years customers have repeatedly been through the front doors and new customers are always surprised to see what there is inside.

Unlike the big box stores, R.E. MacDonald Stoves & Stones’ follow-up warranty processing is available to all our customers. We have been here for 40 years. Customers return time and again, to upgrade their current products, and have us follow through on their warranty issues. If you have a concern with your product, please contact warranty processing at 604-856-1551.

We stock a unique selection of accessories to decorate your home and complement your fireplace includes toolsets, log carriers, screens and more. And for your spring and summer garden enjoyment, we carry an extensive selection of BBQs and accessories, as well as outdoor patio stones for garden walkways, poolside decks, and home and hearth facings.

We pride ourselves as being the ""Store in the Country” that offers a comfortable atmosphere to make your purchase a very pleasurable experience. Rustic wood floors, wood interior and natural stone facings of river rock, ledgestone and marble are the background for a wide range of hearth products not available from mass merchants.",r-e-macdonald-stoves-stones,2010-09-11T21:33:35.000-04:00,NA,NA,NA,,,,,1978,NA,"Credit Card, E-Transfer, Debit, Cheque, Cash ",,,,TRUE,FALSE,,,TRUE,FALSE,Manufacturer warranty available.
