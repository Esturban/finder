On our site visit we capture all site conditions with a 3D laser scanner. Once the site data is processed and the existing 3D model developed, we conduct a virtual 3D walkthrough design discussion of the design for client comments and approval. The next steps is permit production which involves BIM and Engineer team. Then the permit drawing set is turned over to our Permit Expeditor to ensure the most efficient permit review and approval regardless of the municipality. This is our ""done for you"" process that delivers the result every time.
