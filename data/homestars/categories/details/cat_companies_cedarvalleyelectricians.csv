The Authorized Contractor Program was developed by ESA to identify those Contractors who consistently perform Ontario Electrical Safety Code compliant work at a level that reinforces public electrical safety.

The Authorized Contractor Program boasts that only the best Electrical Contractors are current members - only those Electrical Contractors who do consistent, code-compliant work, are allowed on and are permitted to remain on, the Program. As a result, the ESA will selectively inspect work done by CLI Electric rather than conduct full electrical inspections.

By using CLI Electric, our clients experience the following benefits:
•	Uninterrupted workflow.
•	Reduced electrical service downtime during renovation.
•	Increased compliance to the Electrical Safety Code that equates to increased electrical safety.
•	Security of knowing that ESA constantly monitors CLI Electric's work, ensuring we meet the stringent requirements laid out in the Authorized Contractor Program criteria.

The Electrical Safety Authority is the authority responsible for public safety in Ontario. ESA is working to ensure that electrical installations in Ontario meet the Code requirements of the Ontario Electrical Safety Code. This Code requires that an application for inspection be filed with ESA for electrical installations and wiring done in your home or business facility.

Electrical Panel Upgrade
An electrical panel upgrade may be required due to renovation or because your current panel can no longer securely handle your home’s demands. You should know that only a licensed electrician can perform a panel upgrade. Your electrical panel is a vital component of your home and should be well maintained and highly functional. As your electrical needs evolve, you may need to modify your electrical panel to avoid safety difficulties and fire hazards. Additionally, all maintenance on your electrical panel should be performed by a certified electrician.

Electrical Wiring & Rewiring
There are a plethora of reasons why you might require wire installations in a new area of your house. If you need to wire light fixtures, track lighting, ceiling fans, new outlets, switches, electrical panels, sound systems, security cameras, or anything else our electrical team can help. Our electricians have worked on both Commercial and Residential wiring projects; this guarantees that we will be able to perform any electrical repair or installation required to make your property safe.

A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central smart home hub (sometimes called a “gateway”). The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.
